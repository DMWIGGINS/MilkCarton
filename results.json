            "circumstances": "Blaine Hector was last seen on Christmas Eve 2001, running into the woods behind his father's house. Relatives say he was there to show his father a used car he was interested in buying, but the owner of the auto dealership called police and reported the car stolen. When Hector saw the officer pull up to the house, he took off and hasn't been seen since. Police Chief Doug Hackett remembers searching for hours that day with police from three towns, the county sheriff's department, State Police, and a dog. Since he was a stay at home dad with two kids, everyone expected on Christmas Day he would show up, or call to be picked up somewhere. The search continued the next day. In the spring, authorities flew over the area in a helicopter to see if anything would indicate there was a body or a camp or something up in the woods. When he vanished, Hector was 30, married, and living in Milford. His wife has since divorced him, and his father died in 2004, not knowing the fate of his son. Police staked out the funeral, hoping Hector would attend, but he did not come. His mother feels certain that he is alive somewhere and for some reason, he doesn't want to be found. Relatives say Hector, the youngest of three sons, was deeply affected by the death of his brother, New Hampshire National Guard Specialist Wade Hector, who died in truck accident in Saudi Arabia in 1991. After his brother's death, Blaine suffered from depression and dropped out of college. Family says he seemed to not care about anything anymore.",
