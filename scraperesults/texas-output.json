He and two other men, Austin Childs and John Zimmerman, went on a fishing trip on the Gulf of Mexico in Zimmerman's 28-foot pleasure craft. They took a yellow Laborador Retriever dog, several 160-quart ice chests with white snap-on cushions, an orange life ring, a blue and red raft, and three standard-sized orange life jackets on their boat. The men were expected to return the following day, but they did not and they have never been heard from again.\nThe men's boat was later found capsized in the ocean. It had a two-foot hole in the bottom; officials believe the boat accidentally ran into something, possibly a log. A seat cushion and three life jackets were floating nearby. There was no sign of the men at the scene, and an extensive search turned up no trace of them.\n\nChilds, Keller and Zimmerman are presumed lost at sea. All three are from Houston, Texas.",

Prosecutors were able to get an indictment against Taylor after he bragged while in prison on unrelated conviction to having killed Beard at his Clute home. Taylor showed authorities where he thought he buried Beard in a shallow grave, in a rice field just south of Angleton. The search was suspended without finding Beard's remains.\n\nTaylor, 38, was sentenced to life in prison for the murder. He also was sentenced to 25 years for solicitation of capital murder for trying to hire someone to kill a witness who was to testify in the murder case.",

So far, we have not been able to come up with any concrete evidence. The evidence shows that she simply vanished without any trace at all. Items that she would normally take with her were still in her home. However, we will continue to investigate her disappearance.\u201d\n\nChandler\u2019s family has posted a $1,000 reward for information about Chandler, who was believed to have disappeared from her home on State Highway 34 North on the afternoon of Sept. 23, 2007.\n\nHer family was unable to reach her when they tried to call her the next day. The door to her home was found unlocked and the windows open.\n\nAuthorities have theorized Chandler may have begun walking south along Highway 34 toward Greenville from her residence and may have been picked up by a passing motorist. Sheriff\u2019s investigators were able to track Chandler\u2019s scent with bloodhounds five miles along the highway before the trail ended.\n\nIn March 2009 detectives with the sheriff\u2019s office conducted a search of the bridge across Brushy Branch Creek, about three-fourths of a mile south of Chandler\u2019s home, based on a tip which had been phoned in. Items, including a bone, were recovered from the location, although tests revealed none of the items belonged to Chandler and the bone was not human.\n\nChandler remains featured on several Internet missing person sites.\n\nAnyone with any information concerning Chandler\u2019s whereabouts is being asked to contact the Hunt County Sheriff\u2019s Office at 903-453-6800 or Hunt County Crime Stoppers at 903-457-2929.",

She had meet a man in Clovis that was from Houston, over the next year they got to know each other through the internet and texting over the next year. He asked her to move to Houston with him. From what we understand the relationship had its ups and downs with some arguing. On February 11, 2012 Kathy and her boyfriend/fiance had gotten into an argument. He disabled her vehicle so she could not leave the house and then left the house. Kathy and her 18 yr old daughter left the house walking and return to the home after shopping and getting something to eat. Kathy's daughter said Kathy had texted the fiance to tell him she was leaving him and getting a place for her and her daughter as soon as she could during the time they was shopping. Do not know what his response to this revaluation was. After returning home Kathy began watching tv. At some point Kathy and her daughter seen him return to a friends house across the street but did not talk to him. Kathy later went to sleep in the daughters room on a sofa that was in the room. The daughter last seen Kathy asleep on the sofa in pink Eeyor Pajama pants, a white Tshirt at 10:30 PM that night. When the daughter woke up the next morning at 7 am she asked the Fiance where her mom was. He said he had gotten in at 5 am and assumed Kathy was in her daughters room asleep. The daughter began looking and realized the only things gone of her moms was her keys, cell phone, and cigarettes. Kathy's identification, atm card, wallet, clothes, make up and all other possessions remained in the home with the exception of the above mentioned items and the engagement ring and a neckless and ring that he had bought her that she was wearing at the time her white shoes and black jacket was gone as well. Kathy has not been heard from since at this time it has been 47 days. It is not like Kathy to not stay in contact with family. She would not have left her child behind with this man like she had unless she was taken by force.",

A guest arrived at Richerson's office to check out at approximately 6:30 AM and discovered the desk was abandoned. There was no sign of a struggle and Richerson's purse, books and car were left at the resort. One of Richerson's shoes was located in the parking lot later in the morning, but she has never been seen again. Foul play is suspected.",

Wes Collins said Wednesday.\n\nNo evidence of foul play was found at the scene, but in the subsequent investigation, deputies did find blood and other undisclosed evidence at Terry\u2019s home that raised questions about the disappearance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time and no one has heard anything from him,\u201d Collins said.\n\n\u201cThat along with blood we found at Terry\u2019s home sure means he may be a victim of foul play,\u201d Collins said.\n\nTerry, who worked at a garage in Hillsboro, was last seen wearing a black shirt with red lettering, a gray ball and jeans.\n\nHe has brown hair, a full beard, stands 5-foot-9 and weighs about 180 pounds.\n\nInvestigators are asking anyone with information about his whereabouts to call the Hill County Sheriff\u2019s Office at (254) 582-5313.",

Her friends knew she was leaving, but they did not know the person she left with.\nHer parents reported her as missing four weeks later. She didn't take her purse with her, containing her ID and personal information, including money.\nShe abused alcohol and drugs at the time.\nThe man that Elizabeth left the party with was found and questioned, he told the police at that time that he had left the party with Pfeifer.

In the kitchen, the sister saw grocery bags on the floor and a turkey defrosting in the sink.\nThe answer machine was blinking, and when the sister played the message, she was confused. The caller said it was Lorraine, but it didn't sound like her, saying she had met someone and was going to Mexico for a few days. Her sister knew Lorraine would not have left, especially on Thanksgiving.\n\nWhen Lorraine didn't show up by Thanksgiving evening, her sister got concerned. She called police, and Harris County Precinct 4 Constables responded and took the report.\n\n\nAt some point, the case was transferred to the Harris County Sheriff's Department's Homicide Division, and the records have been lost.\nFoul play is possible.",

Merryfield knocked on the trailer window to wake her twin up and the two girls talked for awhile. Merryfield left with the men in their vehicle after her uncle woke up.

Hodgkinson was a welder, had came in that afternoon to shower, then headed out to pick up a part for a grinder that needed to be painted. His mother knew he was planning to come back soon, because he left his welding equipment out, something he never did for long periods of time. Hodgkinson told her not to worry about making him anything for supper, because he would eat while he was out.\n\nFour days later, his father walked into the Pinehurst Police Department to report that his son was missing. Intensive searches were conducted by police, deputies, friends, families and civic organizations.",

The boat a 26-foot cabin cruiser was anchored in Little Devils Cove in Lake Travis, anchored near shore in about 35 feet of water. Deputies said both batteries on the boat were dead.\n\nCrumpacker, an experienced boater and swimmer, had just retrieved the boat from a repair shop. Crumpacker called his wife at 22.00 and told her that he and the boys were getting ready to go to bed. About midnight, Crumpacker told his sons he was going swimming because he had gotten dirty and wanted to clean off. The next morning, he was nowhere to be found, but his blue bath towel was found on the beach. The water temperature was about 55 degrees.\nWhen the boys awoke in the morning, their father was gone. He is presumed to have drowned, but his body has not been found. It is believed that he went for a late night swim alone and never returned.",

He called again later that night, telling her that he was in Texas, and that he would be in Houston in two days. She has not heard from him since. According to men traveling with him, he got sick on July 28th. They said that he was left behind in the desert because he couldn\u2019t continue. He was left with water, under a tree. According to everyone in the group, he was alive when he was left behind. He told someone in the group not to call the Migra because he would look for another way to get there. He was supposedly near between Falfurrias and McAllen, Texas.",
