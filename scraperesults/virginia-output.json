Turner had been a regular customer at that Avis for about a year. What made the situation especially strange is that besides the car she owns being there, a car Turner rented recently had been returned. Neither detectives nor Avis workers are sure who dropped off the rental. Whoever returned it did so after regular business hours. The fuel gauge was on \"E\" and the car wasn't particularly clean, which is out of character for one of Turner's returns.",

He was last seen dropping his daughter off at Sherwood Forrest Elementary School during the morning hours of May 19, 1995 in Norfolk, Virginia. Casper was expected at work at 9:00 a.m. but never arrived. He never returned home and has not been seen again.\nCasper's 1986 Ford van was discovered abandoned in Norfolk on May 30, 1995, 11 days after he disappeared. The vehicle was unlocked and the keys were in the ignition. Casper's wallet was found on the back seat of the van, open to a picture of his family. His driver's license and long-distance calling card were also on the seat, but his military identification was missing. Casper's ashtray in the car was filled with cigarette butts and there was sand on the driver's side floor, which is uncharacteristic of him; he usually kept the car clean and neat. Investigators stated that the evidence in the Ford appeared to have been staged.\n\nCasper's automatic teller machine (ATM) card was used at approximately 9:00 a.m. the day he disappeared. One request was rejected for insufficient funds; in the other, less than $20 was withdrawn. Someone made a series of withdrawals and transfers from Casper's account in the days preceding his disappearance. Some money was transferred to his checking account and about $600 was withdrawn. The money came from advances Casper had gotten for work-related travel, but he had not traveled anywhere. His ATM card has not been used since May 19.\nAgencies investigating:\nNaval Criminal Investigative Service Headquarters\nSpecial Agent John DiPilato 202-433-9225\nNCIS Headquarters, Washington, DC 1-877-579-3648\nNCIS Resident Agency, Norfolk, Virginia (804) 444-7327",

He lived off the main road in a mobile home.\nKiser worked in Trammel, not far from where he lived. He ran H&G Market, which was owned by his brother. Before he started running the store, Kiser had been a sheriff's deputy.\nHe owned property down the road from where he lived. On that land were another mobile home, in which he had once lived, a large old storage building and several inoperative cars.\nKiser collected many junk cars, and he spent a lot of time working on them, salvaging parts. So he visited the property often. He was headed in that direction when his sister last saw him.\nWhen Kiser didn't return home and didn't show up to run his store, his family became worried.\nA girlfriend of Kiser's said he had left on a trip to Alexandria to visit his brother. But he never showed up at his brother's home in Alexandria.\nHis pickup was found on May 4, 1990, parked at his old place. Keys to the vehicle, a tan, 1983 Dodge Ram 150 pickup, were in the ignition, and the driver's window was partially rolled down. A small brown case was found under the seat. In the case was Kiser's checkbook, some cash and food stamps from his store deposit and a few other items. His gun, a .357 Magnum, which his family claims he always kept with him, was missing, however. It has never been found.\nTraces of blood were found in a room built on the back of his old mobile home, but it was never determined if the blood belonged to Kiser. Money has never been withdrawn from Kiser's checking and savings accounts.\n2 agencies investigating:\nDickenson County Sheriffs Office Sheriff Bobby Hammons 276-926-1600\nVirginia State Police First Sgt.

She left driving her red Toyota Tercel, at 3:00 a.m. of September 22. She was last seen driving Interstate 64 westbound from Chesapeake Boulevard. She had mentioned stopping at a Taco Bell franchise, but it is unknown whether she did so.\n\nJones never arrived to pick up her daughter from the child's father's care. Her car was later found parked in her assigned space in front of Breezy Point Apartments, where she lived at 8600 block of Glenn Myrtle Avenue in Norfolk. Authorities found signs of a disturbance in Jones's apartment after her disappearance. The door was unlocked, some items had been broken, and the cords had been pulled out of both her telephones. None of her personal belongings were missing.\n\nJones's parents found the outfit she had been wearing when she was last seen inside her apartment after she disappeared.\n\nJones has not accessed her bank account since she disappeared. She left behind a two-year-old daughter, who now lives with Jones's parents in Red Bank, New Jersey. Her parents and younger sister traveled back and forth between New Jersey and Virginia to search for Jones; her sister died in 2003.\n\nJones attended Norfolk State University. She was employed as a teacher's assistant in a preschool program at Lynnhaven Elementary School at the time of her disappearance.",

Sharon was employed at an automobile parts company in Fredericksburg, Virginia at the time. She phoned her employer and requested the day off from work. Andrew was employed as a truck driver with Panel Construction in Fredericksburg, Virginia at the time of his disappearance. Andrew and Sharon's young son was staying with Andrew's parents on the day the couple disappeared. Andrew's mother told authorities that he arrived at their home with some of their child's belongings and mentioned that he and Sharon were considering traveling to Florida in the near future. Investigators also determined that Andrew asked an acquaintance for money on the day he and Sharon disappeared. The couple's vehicle, a blue 1986 Oldsmobile Calais with Virginia license plates numbered HIQ-285, has never been recovered.\n\nAndrew's family contacted authorities after they were unable to locate the couple by early March 1993, approximately one week after they were last seen. Law enforcement officers searched the Redmons' residence and discovered shell casings from a small caliber handgun, as well as a broken table and other evidence of a struggle. DNA testing proved that blood stains located on the carpet were from Andrew.",

He served 9 years in jail before being released on parole. He admitted to having seen her on the night she went missing. He stated he had come by the Gates home after everyone had gone to bed, and had given Worsky and her friend one can of beer each. Her friend said she and Worsky had actually had more alcohol than that, and got sick afterwards. Afterwards, they went to bed. Barker stated he left at 12:30 a.m., after making sure Worsky, her friend and her friend's younger brother were asleep. Her friend woke up at 5:30 a.m. and realized Katie was missing.

Numerous police officers saw her walking in the Arlandria neighborhood in Alexandria in mid-December 2003 and early January 2004, but she has not been seen or heard from since then.\nWalker's neighbors say she had planned to check into a hospital for mental health treatment in October, so when she disappeared they were not concerned. Searches of area hospitals have not turned up sign of her. She may be in the area of the 3800 and 4100 blocks of Mount Vernon Avenue in Alexandria.",

Monroe was living in a barn on twenty acres of land in the 20200 block of Edgewood Farm in Loudoun County, Virginia at the time. His residence was burned to the ground. Investigators found remains in the fire that were initially thought to be Monroe's, but in October 2005 it was announced that the remains were from Monroe's three dogs and were not human. He has not been seen or heard from since the fire.\nMonroe lead a simple lifestyle and kept to himself prior to his disappearance. He did not have a driver's license, a bank account, or any credit cards. He kept all his money at his home, which was on land owned by his family. Authorities do not believe Monroe's body could have been completely consumed by the fire, and the cause of the blaze has not been determined. His family stated it would be uncharacteristic of him to abandon his dogs or set the house on fire with them inside; he cherished the animals.",

Chin .\n\nChin 's street address was not immediately known, but von Hagn said\nhis family is believed to have homes in Virginia Beach and Richmond.\n\nChin 's boat, a 23-foot Robalo called the Formosa, was spotted about\n40 miles east of Virginia Beach at 10 a.m. by the crew of a Coast\nGuard C-130 search aircraft from the Coast Guard air station at\nElizabeth City.\n\nThe commercial fishing vessel Grumpy, which was nearby, was guided to\nthe scene by the crew of the aircraft.\n\nWhen a crew member of the Grumpy went aboard the Formosa, he turned\noff the engine and secured the vessel.\n\nThere was no indication of what had happened to Chin , however, von\nHagn said. Fishing gear and other items were still in place, and there\nwas no evidence that the boat might have overturned or been swamped.\n\nChin left from Lynnhaven Inlet about 2 p.m. Saturday on what was to\nhave been a three-hour fishing trip in coastal waters close to shore.\nHe was reported missing by a neighbor after he failed to return as\nscheduled.\n\nChin had gone out alone.\n\nThe Coast Guard launched the C-130 as well as an HH-60 Jayhawk\nhelicopter, also based at Elizabeth City, to search for Chin .\n\nThe two aircraft had covered an extensive area of ocean off Virginia\nBeach by sunset, but saw no sign of the fisherman.\n\nIt was not clear how far the small boat may have traveled on its own\nwithout anyone at the wheel.\n\n``It was moving, but not very fast,'' von Hagn said. ``It was going\npretty slow.''\n\nThe vessel was left at sea for the time being.\n\nChin had no known history of medical problems that might help explain\nhis disappearance, von Hagn said.",
