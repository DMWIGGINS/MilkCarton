Jillian â\u20acœJillâ\u20ac\u009d Cutshall was last seen near her babysitterâ\u20ac™s home in central Norfolk. An extensive search for her in the Norfolk area found nothing until in November of 1987. It was then that hunters found childrenâ\u20ac™s clothing in the Wood Duck wildlife area southwest of Stanton, Nebraska. The clothing was positively identified as being the clothing Jill was wearing at the time of her disappearance. An exhaustive search of the wildlife area resulted in no further findings or evidence of her disappearance.\nSince that time, Jill has remained on the minds of all area law enforcement that worked to find and bring her home. Jill has since been declared dead by the State of Nebraska and a Norfolk man is serving a life sentence for the Kidnapping of Jill from Norfolk. A second man has been interviewed numerous times and has never been charged with her disappearance. It is the hope that Jill can be located and brought home for the sake of her family and those that have never forgotten Jill. Jillâ\u20ac™s disappearance remains an open case with both Norfolk and Stanton County law enforcement always looking for information or a location of Jill.\nJillian is a white female, 4'6\" tall, weighs 65 pounds, has straight blond hair and blue eyes. She has a two inch vertical scar on the crown of her head and a horizontal scar on her right top lip. She was last seen wearing a purple shirt, blue jeans and white Nike Tennis shoes.\nCircumstances - Jill was last seen on the porch of the home where she was babysitting. This was about 4 blocks from her home. Jill has not been seen since that time.",

The Nebraska State Patrol investigated the case and the family hired a private detective to no avail.\n\nAlthough authorities suspect Christi Jo Nichols is dead, her body never has been found. At first, police handled the disappearance as a missing persons case, but as time progressed it evolved into suspicion of murder.\n\nAn investigation revealed traces of Christi's blood in the couple's house and in the husbands car. Recent DNA tests have proved that the blood found was indeed Christi's.\n\nHer suitcase, along with her purse was found at a rest stop near Maxwell in 1988.\n\nChristi was in an abusive relationship and had been treated in an emergency room for injuries weeks before she disappeared. She was planning to leave her husband at the time of her disappearance.",
