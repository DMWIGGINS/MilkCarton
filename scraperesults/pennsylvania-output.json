She dropped off her son at her parents' home April 10 before she left on the trip. She reportedly checked into the Pike Motel in Middlesex Township, outside Carlisle, and asked for directions to McDonald's, at about 8 p.m.\nThe last time anyone heard from Ms. Wells was when she called her friend in New Jersey about 7:30 p.m. April 12. Wells' disappearance was discovered when her friend arrived at the Pike Motel early on April 13 to meet Denise as they'd planned. The friend immediately filed a missing person report with Middlesex Township police.\nHer white, Plymouth Acclaim, rented in Tulsa, was found abandoned in a rural part of Perry County, near New Germantown, along Route 274, early in the morning of April 13. State Route 274 runs through the Tuscarora State Forest near New Germantown in the western end of Toboyne Township, Perry County.",

Robert was not carrying any money at the time of his disappearance.

Robert told his mother before he left their home that he expected to find a ride with someone later in the day.

            "circumstances": "Triska was last seen around 23:45 in a car with an unidentified older male at the Route 88 Drive-In Restaurant in Harmony Township, just north of Ambridge, Pennsylvania on September 19, 1958.\nShe never made it home.\n\nShe had gone to a teen dance in Ambridge with friends. Becky left the dance at about 23:30. Two boys who happened to leave the dance around the same time spoke to Becky in front of the theater. She was alone, but an older man, they estimated around 35, was standing in the area and offered to give Becky a ride home. The boys commented that the man was too old to give Becky a ride and, they said, he walked away.\n\nPolice arrested an Ambridge man when they learned that the car Becky was last seen in closely resembled his car. At the time, he was a parolee on a Florida morals charge. He denied knowing Becky, but refused to take a lie detector test. He was held on suspicion of a felony, while his car was sent to the Allegheny County Crime Lab. Investigators found some blood stains and strands of red hair in the car. An attempt was made to match the hair samples from the car against hair taken from Becky's hairbrush, but without the tools available today, it was never definitively proved that the hairs were Becky's. He stated that he had three nieces with red hair and the blood was his.\nAdditionally, he had an alibi. Police learned the identity of the girl that he had a date with on the night Becky disappeared. The girl told police that they had attended a football game in Alliquippa and had parted company between 23:30 and 23:45 that night.\nWith no body and not enough evidence, he was released. He was never charged for Becky's murder.\n\nIn 1962, this same man was convicted and sentenced to death for the 1961 beating death of 13-year old Jane Benfield of Centralia, Columbia County. His death sentence was later commuted to life. He died in prison of cancer in the '90s.\n\nRebecca Ann Triska was declared dead in 1967. Her date of death was recorded as September 19, 1965, seven years after she was last seen.\nHer body has never been found.",

When he got up in the morning her boots, jeans, and coat were gone. Her purse, hearing aid, and car keys were left behind. In addition, her two children who were ages one and six years also remained at home. Mr. Rogers was not initially worried and did not contact police right away. Police further state that her husband fully cooperated with the first investigation and while he has never been ruled out, he is not a suspect either.\n\nNone of her close friends or relatives have had any contact with Rogers since the day of her disappearance.

Surveillance cameras at the Allfirst bank on Dart Drive confirmed Wolf deposited $300 at about 7:33 a.m. that morning. Wolf hasn't been seen or heard from since.\n\nFamily and co-workers began to worry when Wolf didn't show up at work that night. The police were called the next day. After family members notified 911, the Conewago Township Police was dispatched to Wolf's home at 19 Sycamore Lane. The investigation was then turned over to Pennsylvania State Police.\n\nHer vehicle, described as a turquoise 1994 Pontiac Grand Prix was located, locked and secured, two days later, in the Weis Market parking lot, where her sister worked, in Hanover, PA.\n\nWolf left behind her cell phone, which was uncharacteristic of her. And none of her clothing or personal belongings were missing from her closet. Her purse has never been found and her credit cards, which Wolf often used instead of cash, have never been used.\nDiane had never been unaccounted for before.",

There they found his car in the garage, the car keys in the house, and change scattered in the driveway.\nInitially, it was thought that Mr Hart may have gotten lost in the woods while walking his dogs, but police later learned that he had recently sold the dogs.\nState Police organized a search the weekend after Mr Hart disappeared. About 50 volunteers conducted a foot search in the woods surrounding Mr Hart's home, but no trace of him was found. Bloodhounds were brought in, but they failed to pick up his scent.\n\nFoul play is strongly suspected in Jennings Hart's disappearance, but his body has never been found.",

            "circumstances": "Edward Hunsberger and Stephanie Smith, the elder daughter of former Upper Merion High School principal Dr. Jay C. Smith, met in early 1977 when he noticed her crying on a street corner in downtown Philadelphia. Within a few months, they had married.\n\nBoth long-term heroin addicts, Eddie picked up the habit in 1969 while with the Navy in San Francisco and Stephanie had fallen in with a bad crowd by her sophomore year of high school. At the time they met one another, neither held regular jobs, and Stephanie sometimes resorted to working as a prostitute in Philadelphia.\n\nIn September 1977, in an attempt to get clean, Eddie and Stephanie moved into her father\u2019s home in King of Prussia, PA.\n\nThe last verified siting of Stephanie and Eddie Hunsberger was February 25, 1978. The couple visited the home of Eddie\u2019s parents for help filling out their tax returns. As they were leaving, Eddie told his mother, \"We'll be back a little later.\"\n\nAs part of the terms of Eddie\u2019s probation from an armed robbery conviction in 1975, Eddie was required to seek treatment for his drug dependence. Both Eddie and Stephanie had a scheduled appointment at a local methadone clinic in February 1978, but they failed to show. After subsequent missed appointments, the clinic assumed the couple had relapsed. Eddie also failed to keep up regular contacts with his probation officer (a warrant for his arrest was issued on September 6, 1978).\n\nFollowing several weeks without hearing from the couple, Eddie\u2019s mother contacted Dr. Smith who told her that the couple had fled to California for safety because of the amount of money they owed drug dealers.\n\nOn August 19, 1978, police arrested a hooded Dr. Jay Smith in the parking lot of a local mall with four loaded guns and a syringe filled with knockout drugs. A search of his home turned up a library of BDSM and bestiality pornography, three pounds of marijuana, and security guard uniforms that would eventually be connected to unsolved armed robberies from the past year.\n\nHe said the drugs belonged to the Hunsbergers\u2019 and went to jail denying any role in the robbery.\n\nInvestigators made attempts to locate the missing couple as part of the investigation into Smith\u2019s involvement with the local robberies and later when he was tried as an accessory to the murder of Susan Reinert and her children, but no leads ever led to even a substantiated sighting.\n\nJay Smith told his defense team he last saw Stephanie and Eddie together the afternoon of August 19, 1978, the day of his arrest, and that he later saw Stephanie in the spring of 1979. As to why she had not shown up despite his troubles, Smith said that the relationship between the two of them was troubled and Stephanie had no desire to become involved in his legal difficulties.\n\nFurther unsubstantiated sightings were made of Stephanie, but not Eddie, in the next year. A King of Prussia neighbor told investigators she had briefly seen Stephanie sometime in 1979.\n\nIn an unrelated case, an unnamed confidential informant told investigators that he had met with Stephanie in mid-August 1979 and that the Hunsbergers were alive and well in the Philadelphia area.\n\nSmith's younger daughter, Sherwyn, told police that she had seen Stephanie several months after her father was sent to jail on June 25, 1979.",

Within a few months, they had married.\n\nBoth long-term heroin addicts, Eddie picked up the habit in 1969 while with the Navy in San Francisco and Stephanie had fallen in with a bad crowd by her sophomore year of high school. At the time they met one another, neither held regular jobs, and Stephanie sometimes resorted to working as a prostitute in Philadelphia.\n\nIn September 1977, in an attempt to get clean, Eddie and Stephanie moved into her father\u2019s home in King of Prussia, PA.\n\nThe last verified siting of Eddie and Stephanie Hunsberger was February 25, 1978. The couple visited the home of Eddie\u2019s parents for help filling out their tax returns. As they were leaving, Eddie told his mother, \"We'll be back a little later.\"\n\nAs part of the terms of Eddie\u2019s probation from an armed robbery conviction in 1975, Eddie was required to seek treatment for his drug dependence. Both Eddie and Stephanie had a scheduled appointment at a local methadone clinic in February 1978, but they failed to show. After subsequent missed appointments, the clinic assumed the couple had relapsed. Eddie also failed to keep up regular contacts with his probation officer (a warrant for his arrest was issued on September 6, 1978).\n\nFollowing several weeks without hearing from the couple, Eddie\u2019s mother contacted Dr. Smith who told her that the couple had fled to California for safety because of the amount of money they owed drug dealers.\n\nOn August 19, 1978, police arrested a hooded Dr. Jay Smith in the parking lot of a local mall with four loaded guns and a syringe filled with knockout drugs. A search of his home turned up a library of BDSM and bestiality pornography, three pounds of marijuana, and security guard uniforms that would eventually be connected to unsolved armed robberies from the past year.\n\nHe said the drugs belonged to the Hunsbergers\u2019 and went to jail denying any role in the robbery.\n\nInvestigators made attempts to locate the missing couple as part of the investigation into Smith\u2019s involvement with the local robberies and later when he was tried as an accessory to the murder of Susan Reinert and her children, but no leads ever led to even a substantiated sighting.\n\nJay Smith told his defense team he last saw Eddie and Stephanie together the afternoon of August 19, 1978, the day of his arrest, and that he later saw Stephanie in the spring of 1979. As to why she had not shown up despite his troubles, Smith said that the relationship between the two of them was troubled and Stephanie had no desire to become involved in his legal difficulties.\n\nFurther unsubstantiated sightings were made of Stephanie, but not Eddie, in the next year. A King of Prussia neighbor told investigators she had briefly seen Stephanie sometime in 1979.\n\nIn an unrelated case, an unnamed confidential informant told investigators that he had met with Stephanie in mid-August 1979 and that the Hunsbergers were alive and well in the Philadelphia area.\n\nSmith's younger daughter, Sherwyn, told police that she had seen Stephanie several months after her father was sent to jail on June 25, 1979.",

Per statement of friend on boat, they traveled from the ramp about 5 minutes into the river, when the engine stalled and boat started taking on dangerous quantities of water. Joel's friend jumped overboard and swam to shore. Joel stayed with his boat.\n\nWhile swimming to shore, friend looked back and noted boat was nearly fully submerged; he estimated just 2' was above the water line. Friend estimated it took him one hour swimming to reach shore (sea wall) in the area of the former Chester Electric building. Joel was never seen again.\nMultiple searches of the area commenced by private citizens, boats, helicopters, the United State Coast Guard, New Jersey State Police T.E.M.S. Unit and the Chester PA police underwater search and recovery unit. Search protocol included surface survey, dragging river bottom, scuba and side-scan sonar. Search efforts continued on 10-31-09, terminating at 13:45 Hrs.\n\nJoelâ\u20ac™s 14-16' partially submerged run-about pleasure boat bearing vessel bow number PA 991AA was subsequently located down-river on the banks of the Delaware River at Delaware Fox Point State Park, in Wilmington DE at 05:41 AM. The boat was located south of the Commodore Barry Bridge approximately 7.21 miles (see map in documents section). The strong southbound tidal current had carried the boat into Delaware.",

            "circumstances": "Marjorie attended a church service with her family members in Bradford, Pennsylvania during the morning hours of May 8, 1938. Her parents decided to have a Mother's Day picnic afterwards in the White Gravel area, which was a 40-minute drive from Bradford. They drove south along US Route 219, following an old railroad grade from Custer City to Marshburg, Pennsylvania. The Wests entered the White Gravel area from Chapel Fork Road in McKean County.\n\nMarjorie picked wildflowers with her older sister Dorothea later during the day. Dorothea recalled that their parents warned them against walking behind a large boulder near the flowers. She said their father and brother checked the area, but there was a chance that rattlesnakes were hiding near the rock.\nDorothea left Marjorie alone while she spoke to their mother at approximately 3:00 PM. Marjorie disappeared by the time her sister returned to the area. She has never been heard from again. The girls' mother called the police after an initial search of the area by family members produced no evidence as to Marjorie's whereabouts. Police searched with bloodhounds around the rock and down to the road where the scent trail stopped; there near the road were the violets that Marjorie had picked earlier.\n\nWitnesses reported that two vehicles drove past the Wests' picnic site prior to Marjorie's disappearance. The first was going south to Morrison just before three o'clock. The second was going toward Marshburg just after three. Authorities identified the cars and neither was involved in her case.\n\nA taxi driver in Thomas, West Virginia claimed that he saw a girl matching Marjorie's description riding in a dark-colored sedan with an unidentified man. The sighting took place at 11:38 PM on the night of her disappearance. The driver said that the individual asked him where the nearest motel was located. The driver directed him to an establishment across the street, which did not have any vacancies. The man returned and inquired about a local liquor store. The driver instructed him to stop at a bar down the road. The driver identified Marjorie as the man's passenger several days later, but man's identity remains a mystery.\n\nInvestigators determined that the approximate travel time along US Route 219 between the White Gravel area and Thomas, West Virginia was eight hours. If the individual abducted Marjorie around 3:00 PM, they would have arrived in Thomas by 11:00 - 11:30 PM that evening. Authorities were unable to confirm the child's identity.\n\nThere was speculation that Marjorie was taken to Canada by other family members, while others theorized that she may have fallen down an abandoned oil well near White Gravel. Some people believed that Marjorie may have been abducted and taken somewhere in the south or southwestern United States.\nAdditional speculation pointed towards the Tennessee Children's Home Society near Memphis, Tennessee. The facility was operated by Georgia Tann, who was initially lauded for placing at-risk children in adoptive homes. Authorities eventually learned that Tann had kidnapped over 1200 young children during the years 1932 through 1951. The majority of victims were abducted from states bordering Tennessee, although some children resided in Connecticut. Judge Camille Kelly approved Tann's custody bids for the majority of the victims. Tann placed most of the children with childless couples in New York City, New York or Los Angeles, California.\n\nNone of the theories have been proven and no one has been implicated in Marjorie's disappearance.",

He was supposed to check in every hour, but did not do so. Between midnight and 1:00 a.m., while Kerstetter was the only guard on duty, video cameras in operation at the plant recorded that an unidentified, masked man entered the plant and was approached by Kerstetter. The two men met in a corridor, where they spoke for a short time. Another camera later recorded an unidentified man entering the platinum area. The next day, Kerstetter was reported missing. Several days later it was discovered that platinum having a value of $250,000 was also missing. Investigation disclosed no sign of forced entry, and there was no evidence that a struggle had occurred. Kerstetter's gun was found to be missing from its holster, which was in Kerstetter's truck in the parking lot. However, there was no evidence that any gun had been fired. The amount of platinum removed from the plant was such that it could have been carried easily by one person. The disappearance of the platinum and also of Kerstetter are the subjects of continuing investigations by the Bradford Township Police, the Pennsylvania State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Kerstetter has not been seen or heard from since September 13, 1987.",

She was last seen just after midnight with Gary R. Kunish, the bar's owner with whom she had an on-again, off-again relationship.\nPrior to her disappearance, the mother of seven had ended an on-again, off-again relationship with Kunish just before Christmas 1981. She had since begun to date a man from Vandergrift.\nLater that morning, Simpson was reported missing when she failed to return home. Spots of blood was found in the bar.\nJacqueline Simpson has never been found despite intensive police searches. Scuba divers searched two Westmoreland County lakes and helicopters made sweeps over the Alle-Kiski Valley. Other areas that were searched include the Braeburn area of Lower Burrell, areas of water in Allegheny Township, the wooded area by the Bonfire Restaurant on Route 56, a cave behind the former Woodland Drive-In in Parks, the basement of the Magic Lamp, and the former Varos Landfill in Buffalo Township.\nGary Kunish was convicted for murdering Simpson in 1982. Prosecutors won the case despite having no murder weapon, no eyewitness, no confession and no body.",

She was seen returning home in the evening, and a neighbor thought \"someone was with her, or walking behind her.\" Dorothy was attacked and nearly beaten to death. They never found who did it; robbery was not a motive, and Jules was ruled out as a suspect.\n\nThen, in 1950, Jules called his wife to tell him he was going to a political banquet. Dorothy seemed in good spirits. She said, \"Don't forget to miss me!\" before she hung up. When he returned home later that evening, his wife was gone. The eldest daughter was away from home, but the two younger children were found huddled together in a bedroom. None of Dorothy's personal belongings were missing and the front door was locked.\n\nThe older of the two children at home that night (she would have been around 9 years old at that time) said she woke up and went to her mother's room. She saw a man coming up the stairs. She saw her mother lying on the carpet, face down. The man picked up her mother and told the little girl to go back to bed, that her Mommy was sick. She described her mother, who was wearing a red nightgown and red slippers, and the stranger, who was wearing a brown cap and a brown jacket with \"something stuck in his shirt.\" He took the mother downstairs and out the door.\n\nNothing was disturbed in the house and there weren't any fingerprints.\n\nDorothy Forstein has never been seen again.",

He said he was only gone for six or seven minutes but when he got out to the car, at around 8pm, the passenger side door of the car was open and Doris was gone. Her purse was still in the car.\nThe following day, state police, volunteer firefighters and bloodhounds searched the area around the supermarket and scuba divers searched the nearby Allegheny River, but no trace of Doris was found.",

            "circumstances": "http://gangsterreport.com/the-joe-bertone-murder-pittsburgh-hoodlums-death-disappearance-remains-unsolved/\n\nRegarding what happened the night he disappeared the next month several theories emerged. At 10:00 p.m. June 17,1985, Bertone called his wife from the car phone in his Cadillac and told her he was going to stop off at Jordan\u2019s trucking company in Duquesne before returning home with groceries. He called Rosa immediately thereafter and told Rosa to meet him at Jordan\u2019s office. This is where things become hazy.\n\nRosa claims that when he arrived at Jordan\u2019s office, he saw Bertone\u2019s Cadillac being driven off the premises by someone he didn\u2019t recognize and upon asking Jordan if he had seen Bertone at his office, Jordan denied Bertone was ever there. Jordan died in a truck accident in 1988. He told investigators and Bertone\u2019s wife and daughter that Bertone was at his office that night but left after receiving a phone call.\n\nBertone\u2019s new-model Caddy was discovered abandoned at a suburban motel parking lot on June 27, 1985. His widow Louise was summoned to Chucky Porter\u2019s house and given $20,000 in cash. Rosa told authorities Porter and Chiarelli ordered Bertone dead and that Porter only gave his widow the money to avert suspicion away from him in her mind.\n\nSpeculation and assertions surrounding Rosa\u2019s possible involvement in the Bertone murder are bolstered by allegations of Rosa\u2019s own braggadocio. Pittsburgh mob associate-turned-informant Marvin (Babe) Droznek testified in court that Rosa bragged of killing Bertone and knowing where his body is buried. Droznek told jurors that rumors were swirling that Bertone\u2019s days were numbered and that Porter had placed a contract on his head in the weeks leading up to him disappearing. Two Porter confidants spoke to Droznek of Porter issuing orders for Bertone to be killed during the first two weeks of June 1985.\n\nRosa allegedly told other underworld associates that he shot Bertone twice in the back of the head with a 9 millimeter pistol. When Rosa was arrested, FBI agents confiscated a 9 millimeter pistol from the house he shared with his aging grandfather Sica.\n\nJohnny Vento, a Rosa drug courier, testified that he saw Rosa\u2019s cousin, Anthony Bacco shoot Bertone to death in Jordan\u2019s trucking company garage as Rosa looked on and that Rosa himself told him that he and Bacco took and buried Bertone\u2019s body in the Westmoreland County town of Level Green. Per Vento\u2019s testimony, Rosa said that Bertone was being clipped because he was \u201ccheating people he shouldn\u2019t be in drug deals.\u201d\n\nBabe Droznek cooperation, earned by the FBI in 1988, led to Rosa\u2019s decision to join Team America the same year. U.S. Prosecutors believed that Chiarelli provided the murder weapon in Bertone\u2019s slaying and Porter set it in motion \u2013 neither were convicted of the homicide counts in the RICO case. Under cross examination at trial in 1990, Rosa admitted to bragging about committing the Bertone murder, but explained he was lying to enhance his gangland standing.",
