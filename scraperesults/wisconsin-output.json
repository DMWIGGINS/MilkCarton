The wheels, tires and the battery was gone.\n\nThe Sheriff's Department followed up on a tip and found four old tires and the hubcaps from the Hornet in a quarry just south of the Badger Army Ammunition Plant and north of Prairie du Sac. Apparently, somebody had switched the tires from the new car for worn-out tires on their vehicle and then dumped the hubcaps. It is unknown if the stripping of the car and Robert's disappearance are connected, or if somebody found the Hornet after he disappeared and took what they could.\n\nThe Sheriff's Department brought in a bloodhound that followed Robert's trail a short distance from where he car was found, then lost the scent at Tower Road. They also used a National Guard helicopter to search open fields in the area.",

Clemons never arrived at Milwaukee, however. He was last seen walking away from the vehicle near Interstate 90 and Interstate 43 in Beloit, Wisconsin.

He does not have his own car or a cell phone and was with people. He was with a group of his friends earlier that morning and used one of their phones to call another friend who lived down the street for a ride home he stated. This friend was unable to give him a ride and he then used the phone to make another call. A while later, unsure of the exact time, a black vehicle, unknown make/model picked him up. The friends he was with did not recognize the vehicle. It was not like Bilial (aka K.O.) to not tell friends/family where he was headed or when he would be back or get ahold of them next. He also did not have access to his own transportation, which makes the community believe there was someone who was last to see him, we just need to find this person, to determined the time he was last seen and where so we have something to go on.

Klimek\u2019s house appeared fine although there was no sign of him or his truck. There was evidence that he was packing for a planned trip to Las Vegas and the tickets were found at the residence; however, he never made the trip. His mailbox indicated there was mail from as far back as November 8, 1993. During the investigation, it was found that his truck was parked at Mitchell Airport, but there was no record of him taking any flights.\n\nNo one has heard from Kim Klimek since 1993. There were significant events that occurred within Kim\u2019s family, which they believe, would have resulted in him contacting family members, but that did not happen.",
