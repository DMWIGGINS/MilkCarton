When they arrived at the Leskos' house that Sunday night, the husband got out of his truck and went to the door while the children waited in the car. He encountered Cindy and somewhere between five and 20 minutes later, returned to the truck. Rather than leave the kids with their mother, he got back in the truck and drove with the children back to his parents' house almost four hours away. He was the last person to report ever seeing or hearing from Cindy Lesko. The husband has maintained that he arrived at the house to find his wife irrate at his being late. He says she told him to take the kids back with him and get them ready for school the next day himself. According to him, Cindy was alive and well when he left.\nThe Lesko children say they were asleep on and off during the ride home from northern Michigan back home, including the time they were waiting in the driveway.",

However, the Hurley and Foust were not found from these efforts.\n\nAfter considering the search area, inclement weather, and efforts being exhausted from media, investigators, aviation, canine, and foot search teams have exhausted the search of that area.",

Further investigation found entries in her journal that her estranged husband, Roger Junior Sweet, had been having an affair with a 16-year-old mentally handicap girl. Arson was suspected in the fire and Roger later pled to charges of criminal sexual conduct, child pronography and murder charges from his first wife, whom had previously thought to have died of accidental causes.

Eyewitnesses in Renee's daughter's neighborhood told police they last saw her getting into a Pontiac Vibe on Saturday, September 8, 2007. Police say there was also a possible sighting of Renee in a large SUV that could be a Nissan Pathfinder.\n\nPolice had hoped Kyles' food-stamp card would have been helpful in tracking her whereabouts. Unfortunately the card had not been used since her disappearance.\n\nRenee was last known to be living with her sister in Kalamazoo, but has family throughout the Midwest, specifically in Chicago and Kalamazoo.",

Instead of waiting for police, he took off. And that was the last anyone saw of him.\n\nAbout 90 minutes later a passing trucker alerted police that Corlew's car was sitting on the side of I-75 about 15 miles south of Grayling. The engine was still running, the headlights were on and the driver's side door was open. But Perry Corlew was nowhere to be seen.\n\nPolice from Crawford and Roscommon counties called to the scene were baffled. There were no footprints in the snow and no witnesses to what happened.\n\nA police report said Corlew may have gone to downstate Michigan or to Florida. And friends said he had talked of going to California.\n\nIn 1978, his parents thought they spotted him standing in an unemployment line on a national television newscast. They tracked down the report but could not verify the place where the footage was taken because it was shot by a free-lance photographer.\n\nLocal police and the FBI reopened the case in 1992 and a photo was generated of what Corlew would look like at the age of 40.\n\nAlso in 1992, his brother Michael received a telephone call from someone mimicking cartoon character voices, which Michael and Perry used to do. The caller asked Michael what he thought of the voices, but hung up without identifying himself.",

Custer Training Center. He has never been heard from again. An extensive search of the area turned up no indications as to his whereabouts.\nAt the time of his disappearance, Anderson had a misdemeanor warrant out for his arrest; his mother speculated that he left the accident scene to avoid contact with the police. Anderson's mother stated her son always kept in regular contact with her and she fears he may have met with foul play. His case remains unsolved.",

The vehicle was found in a parking lot at the corner of Grand River Avenue and Cedar Street in Lansing. There was no sign of Gottschalk at the scene, but cyclists found two bags belonging to him on the Shiawassee Street bridge. Divers searched the water beneath the bridge but found no clues relating to Gottschalk's case. There was nothing missing from the bags except Gottschalk's black leather jacket, his Detroit Lions coat, his wallet, and a watch his mother had given him. His case remains unsolved.",
