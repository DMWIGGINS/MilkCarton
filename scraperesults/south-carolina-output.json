Frankie had traveled from South Carolina to Kansas with a female friend (name unknown.) She called her brother in Harrisonburg, VA to see if they could stay with him for a few days before going back to SC. Her friend, Bob/Robert in Kansas who she and her friend had been staying with, had been on the road (as a truck driver) and when he returned, her mother in SC called him and he told her that Frankie and her friend had already headed back. No communication with any family member has been made since then. Whereabouts were unknown. Circumstances regarding her disappearance are also unknown. She traveled a lot, often hitchhiking to various states such as FL, VA, KS, OH, SC, though rumors say she may have gone to CA and/or AZ at one point as well. Nothing substantial has transpired or been validated with Frankie since 1989. Most addresses found had no date provided at all. She has family in both VA and SC. She gave birth to children in SC and KS. None of her children have heard from her either.",

Investigators found pry marks on the door. Two small appiances were damaged, and someone deficated on the floor, and on a bed. All of these factor indicated possible foul play, or at least the victim could have come to some kind of harm. An extensive search including blood hounds, and aerial support was conducted, but the victim was not found.",

Webb, 45, had been camping alone in the forest, near the North Carolina line, since Wednesday. ``At this point, we don't suspect foul play,''county Sheriff James Singleton said. \"There are some slits in the tent, but we don't know if he cut the tent to let air in or if it was vandalized.\"\n\nState, local and federal authorities searched the forest and the Chauga River for six hours Monday, using all-terrain vehicles, a kayak and an airplane. Deputies were talking to Mr. Webb's friends to determine if anyone had seen him or knew where he might have gone, Sheriff Gordon said.",

After playing ball, he dropped off one of his friends at a residence on Murray Johnson Road in Conway, South Carolina. The other friend states that he and Malinowski then went to a woman's residence on 7th Avenue in Aynor, South Carolina. They both stayed at that residence until approximately 11:30 p.m. The friend states that Malinowski left in Malinowski's car, a 1996 dark purple/burgundy Chevy Beretta to get something to eat and go home. He hasn\u2019t been seen since. The last phone contact was approximately 12:15AM on 08/26/13.\n\nHorry County police later found Malinowski's car in the woods off of Valley Forge Road near Aynor. The car was completely burned and there was no sign of Malinowski.",

But none of her clothing was determined to be missing from the apartment. Her parents reported her missing because she never got in touch with them after a vacation to Florida. Hayslette's credit card or bank card were never used after her disappearance. She was a straight A student at Coastal Carolina University and she missed her final exams. She also worked part time there and never picked up her final pay check. In 1995, Hayslette's husband was charged with the forging of his wife's signature on a vehicle title and he was sentenced to jail time for that. In 1996 Hayslette's husband was charged in the disappearance of his wife and with her murder. The murder charge was dropped due to lack of evidence. Her body has never been found. The case is still considered open and unsolved.",

Later that night, and into the next morning, a relative received a series of text messages. The first indicated that she was going downtown, another that she would be out with a friend named Miguel(of whom her family had never heard). The last message said she planned to return to Mexico, her native country. Her family doesn't think she sent the text messages, as she did not normally communicate via text messages.\n\nViridiana is a native of Mexico and speaks Spanish.",

Her sister reported her missing on October 10.\nRichardson's teal green 1994 Ford Mustang was recovered in St. Mary's, Georgia in October 2003. Her husband's sister (Anita's sister-in-law) was driving it. Richardson and her husband also owned a red 1987 Toyota pickup truck and a gray 1992 Chevrolet Lumina. Authorities believe Richardson could have been taken against her will. After August, the couple failed to pay the rent and was served with two eviction notices. The husband was gone by then, leaving most of her belongings behind including clothes, tv, vcr, a mattress and a refrigerator full of food.",

Bing was accompanied by his friend, El Shawndrae Jones, at the time. Both men were last seen at approximately 6:30 p.m. in the 100 block of Wild Horse Road. They were driving Bing's white 1994 Toyota pickup truck at the time of their disappearances. Neither Bing or Jones has been heard from again.\nBing's vehicle was discovered abandoned in Savannah, Georgia on February 24, 1999, six days after he and Jones vanished.
