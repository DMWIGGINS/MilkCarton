At 7:30 a.m. Skirta's father woke up and found the back door slightly ajar and his son missing.\nHe did not take any identification, money, or his bicycle or eyeglasses when he disappeared. Bloodhounds traced Skirta's scent out the back door of the residence to the mailbox, but the trail was lost there.\nHis father said that before his disappearance, Skirta seemed very withdrawn. Skirta is described as well-read and intelligent but ill at ease with people. He has worked various jobs, including as a volunteer at the snack bar at Helen Ellis Memorial Hospital, but has never stayed at any one job for very long.",

This is approximately seven miles west of John's Pass, Madeira Beach, Florida.

Peek\u2019s girlfriend was on the phone with him, when she heard a verbal argument between Peek and his roommates. The girlfriend then heard a loud noise that she considers to be a gun shot and then heard the other occupants of the apartment referring to Peek\u2019s well-being. During the subsequent investigation, it was revealed that a witness in the apartment complex had observed two males dragging a rolled up carpet down the steps on the outside of the apartment complex while a female was observed to be \u201cwiping\u201d the steps behind the carpet. Peek has not been seen or heard from since the incident and is suspected of being the victim of a homicide. The body of Tremaine M. Peek has not been located and he is still listed as missing.",

The car was locked.\nThornton relied on three types of medication, which she did not have with her at the time. It is speculated that Thornton was suffering from a memory lapse, and had driven aimlessly onto the Osceola ranch, and later wandered into the 20.000 acres of wilderness.\nHer pocketbook and umbrella was discovered in March 1984, by a hunter, near Lake Hatchineha.

The witnesses did not immediately report this incident until after a missing persons investigation was initiated. The area where this occurred was searched extensively but a body was never recovered.

            "circumstances": "Garcia was last seen leaving work in Deerfield Beach, Florida on July 2, 2009. On July 5, after she didn't show up for work, her coworkers went to her residence in the 700 block of Mermaid Drive to find out why. Garcia's live-in boyfriend answered the door and told them she wasn't home. Her coworkers reported her missing on July 7. Garcia left all her belongings behind in her apartment, and her boyfriend used her credit cards after her disappearance. He told police that Garcia had moved out on July 3. Garciaâ\u20ac™s boyfriend was arrested and charged with first-degree murder in May 2010. Foul play is suspected in Garcia's disappearance due to the circumstances involved.",

She worked the night shift at the time of her February 4, 1990 disappearance. Poe's boyfriend saw her inside the store at approximately 1:00 a.m. A friend who drove by the store at 3:00 a.m. saw her standing behind the counter. At between 3:15 and 3:30 a.m., a witness in the vicinity reported seeing a young man with long black hair, wearing a black t-shirt with a Megadeth logo and a wire earring with a cross in his right ear. Poe's store was discovered unoccupied at 4:00 a.m. A cup of coffee and a carton of chocolate milk were on the floor behind the counter, and her car was undisturbed in the parking lot. There was no sign of a struggle at the scene. She has never been heard from again.",

Just prior to his disappearance, he was involved with evicting a tenant, Edward William Vanderbilt, age 58, for non-payment of rent. There was no sign of forced entry at Israel's house. Nothing was missing. His car still was parked in the driveway. Neighbors saw or heard nothing unusual. Israel recently had injured his foot and probably would have been hobbling. Because of this injury, he drove almost everywhere, even if he was visiting neighbors. He usually returned home by dark. In the 30 years he has lived in Florida, he never had spent a night away from his house. Investigators believe that Harry Israel is the victim of a murder.",

He was enroute to West Palm Beach, FL to visit his daughter at her home. He never arrived to his daughter's house and has not been heard from since.\n\nPolice discovered David Lee Armstrong, a transient and fugitive from Mountain View, AR, had used Morse's credit cards after his disappearance. Armstrong also sold Morse's silver 1964 Ford step van to his own uncle for $70. The interior of the van was heavily stained with Morse's blood and there was evidence of human tissue, including brain cells. Authorities had determined that there was enough blood present in the van to prove that Morse had sustained fatal injuries.\n\nArmstrong was apprehended by police in Illinois when he was arrested for forgery in connection with Morse's credit cards. He was also wanted in Arkansas for an escape charge. Armstrong confessed to killing James Morse. He said that Morse had picked him up as a hitchhiker; he then beat and stabbed Morse to death. Armstrong claimed to have dumped Morse's body in a sugar cane field near Belle Glade. An extensive search was conducted, but the body was never found.\n\nDavid Armstrong pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 15 years in prison for manslaughter in August, 1982. Police have searched for Morse's body without success.",

At the time of her disappearance, Leppert was planning to go to California to act in some movies. She apparently never arrived there, however.\nInformation from the Charley Project",

            "circumstances": "Mandy Ciehanoski, 33, was reported missing by family members on Feb. 14. However, she hasn\u2019t been seen since about a week before then. Last month, the Sheriff\u2019s Office\u2019s Major Case Unit declared the case a homicide and arrested a former boyfriend of the missing woman for impeding the investigation.\n\nhttp://www.volusiasheriff.org/press/2011press_releases/march/110044.htm\n\nFebruary 15, 2011\nGary Davidson\nPublic Information Officer\n\nVOLUSIA DEPUTIES SEARCHING FOR MISSING HOLLY HILL WOMAN\n\nThe Volusia County Sheriff\u2019s Office is seeking the public\u2019s help in locating a 31-year-old Holly Hill woman who hasn\u2019t been seen in a week. Relatives contacted the Sheriff\u2019s Office on Monday to report Mandy Ciehanoski missing. They said they didn\u2019t immediately contact authorities because she had gone missing in the past. But after a week went by with no word, they became worried enough to call the Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nAccording to relatives, Ciehanoski left her home at 1119 Valencia Ave. on Feb. 7, saying she was going to help a friend with an errand. That was the last her family has seen of her. At one point, Ciehanoski was driving a friend\u2019s pickup truck. However, the truck was found abandoned in a park in Ormond Beach on Feb. 8.\n\nCiehanoski, who reportedly has struggled in the past with drug and alcohol problems, is 5\u20194\u201d and weighs approximately 110 pounds. She has hazel eyes and shoulder length brown hair. Anyone with information regarding Ciehanoski\u2019s whereabouts is asked to call the Sheriff\u2019s Office at (386) 248-1770.\n\nFebruary 25, 2011\nGary Davidson\nPublic Information Officer\n\nPERSON OF INTEREST ARRESTED IN SEARCH FOR MISSING WOMAN\n\nMissing for nearly three weeks without a trace, the Volusia County Sheriff\u2019s Office is now calling the search for a 31-year-old Holly Hill woman a homicide investigation. Thursday night, the Sheriff\u2019s Office arrested an Ormond Beach man considered a person of interest in the disappearance of Mandy Ciehanoski. While the search for Ciehanoski continues, the Sheriff\u2019s Office has charged ex-boyfriend Michael Annicchiarico with impeding the investigation by lying about being with the woman.\n\nFamily members reported Ciehanoski as missing to the Sheriff\u2019s Office on Feb. 14. By that time, she had already been gone for a week. Sheriff\u2019s investigators have been interviewing family and friends in an effort to find out what happened to Ciehanoski. Among those interviewed was Annicchiarico, who used to date the missing woman. He initially told investigators that he hadn\u2019t seen the victim for about two years. He later changed his story, admitting that he had seen Ciehanoski as recently as December. Investigators, however, learned that also was a lie after they obtained surveillance video that showed the two together just five days before Ciehanoski\u2019s disappearance. Confronted by investigators with the evidence from the surveillance video, Annicchiarico has now admitted that he last saw the victim on Feb. 7, which was the last time anyone has seen or heard from her. Investigators said Annicchiarico also lied about what vehicle the victim was driving on the day of her disappearance. Based on information uncovered during the investigation, Sheriff\u2019s officials now believe that Ciehanoski was the victim of foul play and is most likely dead. The investigation has now been turned over to the Sheriff\u2019s Office\u2019s Major Case Unit.\n\nAfter bringing Annicchiarico in for another interview Thursday night, the Sheriff\u2019s Office arrested him on charges of making a false report to law enforcement and providing false information to law enforcement during an investigation. Investigators also charged him with forgery and unlawful transfer of a title for illegally transferring ownership of a car that didn\u2019t belong to him. Additionally, Holly Hill Police have charged Annicchiarico with grand theft.\n\nAnnicchiarico, 33, of Ormond Beach, is being held at the Volusia County Branch Jail in Daytona Beach on $13,500 bond. Anyone with information about Annicchiarico or the whereabouts of Ciehanoski is asked to contact Sheriff\u2019s investigator Beth Fortin at (386) 248-1777.\n\nPrevious news release: http://www.volusia.org/sheriff/press/110026.htm",

At 6:15 p.m., Raulerson spoke to his wife and mother and said he was going to help a friend who was having problems with his truck. Raulerson left driving his wife's blue Nissan Pathfinder and has never been seen again. The car was found abandoned on August 5, at the gate to a hunting club on Georgia Highway 121, between the towns of St. George and Macclenny. There was no sign of Raulerson at the scene. He had a habit of parking his car and riding with someone else onto the hunting club. Witnesses reported seeing the Pathfinder at the gate at 9:00 p.m. on August 4. He resided in Macclenny, Florida at the time of his disappearance.\n2 agencies investigating:\nBaker County Sheriff's Office 904-259-2861\nCharlton County Sheriff's Office 912-496-7321",

He was on his way to Key West to the courthouse to pay some fines. Brown lived aboard a boat offshore of the Geiger Key Marina, with his dog Nadine. After receiving a call that he might be missing, officers went to the boat to check on him. They found the dog was still there, along with William\u2019s cell phone. William, however, was gone along with the small dinghy he used to row back and forth to shore. Neither William nor the dinghy have been seen since.\n\nA search was conducted of the waters around the area with no results. Detectives canvassed other boats in the area and spoke with people at the marina who knew William, along with a number of others with connections to him. At this point, they have exhausted all leads in the case.\n\nWilliam is described as a white male with long grey hair and a beard. He is 5\u20198\u201d tall and thin \u2013 about 100 pounds. He had a tattoo of an ant in his belly button.",

The weekend of her disappearance she had backed out of a camping trip with her parents and siblings saying that her husband, \"Earl\" had called to say he was coming home. Her husband returned, their oldest son recalls arguing and his father's stern orders \"not to look outside.\" The son believes that Margaret's body may have been wrapped in a red blanket which Earl retrieved from the house. Earl reported Margaret missing during the wee hours of the next morning. Her car and purse were found in a local department store parking lot. However, no eyewitnesses could place her or her car at the scene during business hours.Margaret has not been seen or heard from since. It is likely that she would have been concealed within hours distance of the home.",
