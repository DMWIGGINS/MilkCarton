            "circumstances": "The Reno Police Department and Humboldt County Sheriff's Office are asking for the public's assistance in locating a missing person. Patrick Carnes (86 years old) who was last seen alive in the area of Wells, Nevada on Wednesday, April 13, 2011. He was traveling to Reno, Nevada from Toledo, Ohio. His car was later located abandoned off of I-80 between Golconda and Battle Mountain, in Humboldt County. Carnes was traveling with his canine companion Lucky. Lucky is a large 80-100 pound brown mixed breed male dog.\n\nPatrick and his dog, Lucky, were heading home to Reno when they both mysteriously vanished on April 13, 2011.\n\nIn early April 2011, Patrick Carnes traveled from his home in Reno, Nev., to visit family in Ohio. There, he looked at retirement homes where he could spend his golden years.\n\nPatrick, a World War II vet who served in the Solomon Islands, was a proud, active man, with no signs of slowing down.\n\nOn April 12, he packed up his dark green Subaru wagon and drove back to Reno with his best friend, a slightly overweight, 100-pound Akita/mixed-breed dog named \"Lucky.\"\n\nThe following night, just after Patrick and Lucky entered the state of Nevada, a trooper pulled Patrick over for not changing lanes appropriately near the town of Wells. After speaking briefly with the officer, Patrick got off with a warning and continued his late-night trek across the state via westbound I-80.\n\nThough they were only about a six hour drive from Reno, Patrick and Lucky never made it there.\n\nThe next morning, Patrick's car was found abandoned in sage brush, a good distance from the highway in rural Winnemucca.\n\nWhen investigators came upon Patrick's vehicle, they found no signs of foul play. The car was a good distance from the road, and its front end was facing the interstate. There was no evidence leading investigators to believe Patrick and Lucky were abducted, but they can't rule anything out.\n\nAfter doing extensive air and ground searches of the vast, wide open, Nevada desert, cops in Humboldt County have come up completely empty-handed. There hasn't been a single sighting of the missing duo.\n\nWhen Patrick was pulled over in Wells, he told the trooper he was going to get a room in nearby Elko that night, but there's no record of him ever doing so.\n\nWhat happened overnight remains a mystery to investigators, and they need your help to piece the clues together.\n\nIn the middle of the night, every night, I-80 is dominated by big rigs. Detectives believe a trucker might have seen what happened to Patrick and Lucky, but no one has come forward as of yet.\n\n\"Some trucker saw an old man with a dog,\" Humboldt County Undersheriff Curtiss Kull said.\n\nConsequently, investigators would like to make a plea to anyone -- specifically long-haul truck drivers -- who may have driven on I-80 between Wells and Winnemucca, and saw Patrick and Lucky between the late evening hours of April 13 through the early morning hours of April 14.\n\nIf you know anything about the bizarre disappearance of Patrick Carnes, or his best friend, Lucky, you've got to call our toll-free Hotline right away at 1-800-CRIME-TV. Remember: You can remain anonymous.\n\n@ Info Posted on America's Most Wanted Website.",

He had borrowed his ex-wife's car and returned the car to her around 8 PM on Jan 24 and she drove him back to the hotel. He was very upset that he wasn't going to have the car. When she dropped him off he was headed to the back of the building. He said he was going to see if the laundry room was available, but he also said that at night there was some \"shady stuff\" going on behind the hotel. His ex-wife returned the newt morning to take him to the bus station but he didn't answer the door. He also hadn't checked out. The hotel manager and staff kept an eye out for him over the weekend but no one saw him return. They confirmed he had started packing but never returned. Earlier in the week 1/22 and 1/23 I put $450 on his WalMart Visa for the trip home. His dad also sent him a money order for another $400. He confirmed via email receipt of money on 1/22. But he stopped returning our calls. The only call he would answer was from his ex-wife to set up delivery of the car. In addition to the $850, he also had a brand new lap top, and pre-paid cellphone. He has not responded to any emails and the cellphone is out of minutes.",

There is no record of her checking in at that hotel.\nPalumbo's vehicle was discovered illegally parked and abandoned at the airport on April 27, one day after her disappearance. The majority of her personal belongings were found inside the car, along with her cellular phone and her purse, which contained $600 in cash.\nThe owner of the Silver Dollar Casino in Elko, Nevada claimed that Palumbo was inside her establishment in December 2000, eight months after Palumbo disappeared. The owner told authorities that the woman became nervous when she saw a man peering through the bar's window during the evening. According to the owner, the woman then departed from the Silver Dollar Casino with another female. Authorities have been unable to confirm if the unidentified woman in the establishment was indeed Palumbo. Foul play is suspected in her case.",

She never arrived at her destination and her family reported her missing a short time later.\n\nIn November 1982, Nan Dixon's Datsun was found by coyote hunters in a ravine below the main road of the Seven Troughs turnoff. It had been discovered in an area that had been previously searched from the air and by ground. The car appeared to have been deliberately driven over a rocky road and into the ravine. Tire tracks could be seen where it left the road and traversed down into the gulch. The tires were badly scuffed from having been driven over the rocky road, but otherwise held air and were considered to be in reasonably good condition. The car also contained a half tank of gasoline.",
