Its doors were open, tires were flat and it was out of gas. A search of Harker's residence on Colon Street turned up no clues as to his whereabouts.\n\nHarker's mother reported him missing on October 9, 1996. His dog was left at his house, and it hadn't been fed in four or five days, and he had left behind his medicine.\n\nHarker's family are convinced Kenny didn't get disoriented and wander off and die due to exposure, because someone out mushroom hunting or a farmer or another individual would have found him by now. And, Kenny's close attachment to friends and family kept him from wanting to live elsewhere.\n\nFoul play is suspected.",

The last time he left, he never came back.\n\nAccording to family members he wasn't acting like himself in the months prior to his disappearance. He was depressed and also had other problems that were hard for him to handle and may have been using drugs. Kellar's family reported him missing in 1992, two years after he left on his last cross-country trip. They assumed he would be back. Muscatine Police took the report but didn\u2019t find evidence of a crime. Because there was no indication of foul play in the disappearance of Kellar, the investigation concluded that he left the area voluntarily.\n\nKellar's family believes he is residing in another state probably Colorado, California, New York or Florida.

Her six year old son told investigators that when he woke up on Saturday morning his mother was not there. Alice's purse and money were found in the apartment and relatives believe she left without a coat and shoes.\n\nIt didn't appear that there was a struggle in the apartment but investigators did find a broken bottle on the floor. They also found a door to Alice's car open and the keys in the ignition.\n\nBased on interviews with Alice's friends and family, she was very close to her family and was a good mother who would not have voluntarily left. Alice has four children who were 3, 4, 6, and 8 when she sent missing.\n\nLaw enforcement believes Alice's disappearance is \"mysterious\" and that foul play is feared but has not been confirmed.",

Butter had been left on the kitchen table and a deer steak left in the microwave oven.\n\nStookesberry also had four dogs, all of which had been left behind -- something Stookesberry never would have done under normal circumstances. Stookesberry's laundry had been left outside the full week, hanging on a line.\n\nHe did not drive and used a cane to get around. Officials believe he was taken against his will and classified his disappearance as missing and endangered.",

The vehicle was left unattended with the motor running.\n\nSioux City Police were called to check Zellmer\u2019s residence at 1003 Pierce Street, Apt. B-3, and found it empty with nothing unusual within the apartment.\n\nLater the following day, Ronald\u2019s mother Lucille was asked to come to the Sioux City Police Station where she filed a missing persons report.\n\nThe Iowa Department of Public Safety\u2019s Missing Person Information Clearinghouse lists his status as an involuntary disappearance.\n\nAccording to family members, Ronald Zellmer was very depressed and had suffered from depression for years. A search of the Missouri River proved unsuccessful in retrieving Zellmer\u2019s body.",

He told his supervisor that he had to leave to get his medicine but did not return to work. Two days later his roommate notified his dad that he had not come home. Jesse's dad put a public post on Facebook asking if anyone had seen Jesse. The following morning his truck was spotted on Canyon Road in Ledges State Park. The keys were in the ignition and the doors were unlocked but there was no sign of Jesse. Search dogs were brought in and were unable to locate a scent.",
