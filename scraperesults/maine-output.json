Shannon Atwood was subsequently arrested and convicted for the murder of Cheryl Murdoch. During the early stages of the investigation into the Murdoch homicide, neighbors and family members expressed concerns on the whereabouts of Shirley Atwood, who normally was found to be at home with her husband, Shannon Atwood. Shannon Atwood was indicted for her murder even though her body was not found. The Shirley Atwood murder indictment was later dismissed without prejudice by the Maine AG's Office. Shirley Atwood's body has not been located.",

Jason stopped taking needed medication and may exhibit agitation, pacing, mumbling and anxiety. He is of no threat to anyone, however, his condition makes him vulnerable and at-risk. Jason is more than probably in shelters or living on the street or possibly with an unknown person for shelter. It was found that he used his debit card at a Rite Aid Store in Brunswick, Maine on January 18, 2012 so it is believed that he is still in the area. Jason is an excellent artist and poet. His family is extremely worried and ask the public to please help look for Jason.",
