Storm, in Grant County, West Virginia. The man wanted Ms. Ford to meet him at his office at 3:00 p.m. the same day, to discuss some checks. Later that day, a man claiming to be an undercover officer called Ms. Ford with information concerning a possible investigation of her family's restaurant by the liquor licensing authorities. Ms. Ford told her family and the restaurant employees to check identifications before selling beer, and then left the restaurant to meet with the alleged undercover officer. Ms. Ford drove her Ford Bronco on route 50 into Grant County, and turned off at the Bismark Road. She has not been seen since.",

            "circumstances": "Gutierrez was last seen leaving the Kenwood Country Club in Bethesda, Maryland on August 22, 1980.\nThe Montgomery College student from Rockville, who was known to most as Cecilia, was working two summer jobs to pay for her education and make ends meet. She had a position at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda and had been working for about a week as a cocktail waitress at Kenwood Country Club, also in Bethesda. After finishing her shift at Kenwood one night, Gutierrez left to meet her fiance and some friends at a local nightclub. Gutierrez has not been seen since. On August 23, 1980, the day after her disappearance, her 1971 Dodge Challenger was found in a parking lot adjacent to a bus stop near NIH. Gutierrez was supposed to pick up a friend near NIH by 9:30 p.m. August 22, 1980. Although a co-worker saw her car leaving the country club shortly after she checked out of work at 9:25 p.m., he could not confirm whether she was in it.",

Demyon drove away from his house in the unit-block of Gurteen Court in Cockeysville at around 6:15 p.m., driving to a nearby motel to use a pay phone. His car, a 1989 dark blue Pontiac Bonneville, was found on February 20, 1997 in the 1800-block of North Calvert Street in Baltimore City. No evidence of foul play was discovered. Mr. Demyon was the vice president of Safety/Sight Incorporated in Cockeysville, a firm founded by his late father. He was an avid gambler, and frequented Las Vegas, Atlantic City, and the horse tracks, and was apparently in debt to several gambling associates.",

Phone records indicate no recent activity and the phone has been turned off. Colicchio has no children or known girlfriends and is known to keep to himself.\n\nColicchio is a stone mason by trade and uses his deceased father\u2019s company name of Colicchio & Sons.

He was found talking to a neighbor and had suffered what appeared to be cigarette burns from a person he described as a \"bad boy\".\n\nHe enjoyed cars and would, therefore, get into any car, if he was asked to.\n\nHe was spotted on a few occasions just after his disappearance. A neighbor of the Hagers', recognized him at the corner of Dundalk and Eastern Avenues that afternoon. Also, a family friend of the Hagers', told Mrs. Hager that in 1962 a young man about 26 or 27 was seen in a grocery store in Dundalk. He was unable to speak, but had handed her a grocery order to fill, and she did so. He never returned to the store and no one has seen or heard from him since.",

            "circumstances": "Thresher had dinner with her parents during the evening of May 23, 2000 in her hometown of Bethesda, Maryland. She returned to her residence in Sumner Highlands Apartments in the 4500 block of Sangamore Road later that night. Thresher spoke to an acquaintance on the telephone at approximately 10:00 PM and e-mailed her employer at 12:00 AM on May 24. Thresher has not been heard from since.\n\nThresher was scheduled to begin a new position as a copy editor for The Washington Post's Web site on the day she disappeared. Her family has stated that she was excited about the job and it is very uncharacteristic of her to leave without warning.\n\nThresher's copper-colored 1997 Volvo station wagon was discovered abandoned on May 25, one day after her disappearance.Thresher's vehicle was parked on the corner of Ridge Drive and Broad Street near the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal in the Glen Echo area, which is several miles from her apartment. There was no sign of her at the scene and an extensive search of the surrounding areas produced no clues as to Thresher's whereabouts. Her wallet and keys were not discovered inside her car and investigators presume that Thresher had the items in her possession when she disappeared. Investigators released a composite image of an unidentified man spotted near Thresher's apartment complex during March and April 2000. The individual has not been named a suspect, but authorities would like to identify him and question him about Thresher's case. He may have spoken to her prior to her disappearance. The man is described as possibly being of Hispanic descent and 48 - 50 years old in 2000. He is 5'4 with black hair and was clean-shaven at the time. The individual may be driving a 1990 four-door white sedan.\n\nThresher's family elected to declare her legally deceased in February 2001. Her sister took control of Thresher's retirement funds and established a trust for Thresher's children's educations. Thresher's former husband was granted custody of their two children.\n\nA $647.08 check was mysteriously deposited into Thresher's bank account in April 2002. The check had been issued in her name by the Maryland Department Of Human Resources in March 2000. The amount reflected child support collected by agency from Thresher's former husband. The check was deposited in the night depository box of a bank in Alexandria, Virginia. Authorities are investigating any connection the check may have to Thresher's disappearance",

Police received a report Aug. 12 that David Gipson Smith, 28, of Pilesgrove, N.J., was last seen in the Woodbine area on Aug 6.\n\nSmith\u2019s family contacted police Aug. 12 to report that Smith had not returned home or reported to work after coming to Maryland on Aug. 5 to visit a friend. The family reported that it was unusual for Smith to be out of contact for an extended period of time and that they were concerned for his welfare. They told police they believed a friend had dropped Smith off in the general area of the 2000 block of Woodbine Road on Aug. 6.\n\nPolice responded to the area in Woodbine and initiated a search. Police and fire personnel have conducted land and air searches for Smith in woods around the area, and conducted a search of a nearby pond. Officers have canvassed the surrounding area and have spoken with local residents, but there have been no sightings of Smith or indications of his whereabouts.\n\nInvestigators have checked with local hospitals and shelters in the search for Smith. They have interviewed his friends and family, and confirmed that no one has been in contact with him. Due to the duration of his absence, police are concerned for his welfare.\n\nSmith is described as a white male, 6 ft. 4 in. tall, weighing 230 pounds. Police do not have a clothing description. Investigators are releasing photos of Smith in the hope that someone will see him.\n\nAnyone with information should contact Howard County police at 410-313-STOP or email HCPDcrimetips@howardcountymd.gov. Anyone who sees Smith should call 911.",

The evening of November 5th, 1980 she flew to Baltimore Maryland, to attend a private party. She allegedly spent the night there in a motel after the party and had breakfast with the man whose party she had attended. After breakfast Snow waited with the man in his car until her temporary housesitter picked her up. He arrived driving a car, which one witness remembers to have been a type other than Snow's Turquoise V.W. convertible.

Mileo disappeared on June 9th, 1983 after leaving her boyfriend's house in Croom, Maryland at approximately 2:30 am. Mileo spent Wednesday, 8 June 1983 at the home of a girl friend. With them that day was Kim Mileo's boy friend, who lived with his parents only a mile up the road. The three of them spent part of the day sitting around the pool and later all three went for a drive in the rural setting of Croom, all arriving back at home later that afternoon. Croom is a small country village about 20 miles south of Washington DC. Her friend stated that Mileo and her boyfriend argued periodically during the day, but the disagreements were not serious. Mileo and her boyfriend departed from her friend's residence at approximately 11:00 PM and headed to his parents' home on Mount Calvert Road. Mileo's family became concerned when she did not return to their house in Kettering, Maryland the following morning. Her father phoned her boyfriend, who claimed that Mileo left his residence at approximately 2:30 AM on June 9. Her boyfriend's father supported his son's statement, saying that the broken muffler on Mileo's gray 1972 Chevrolet Vega with Maryland license tags ADG-075 woke him around that time. Mileo's vehicle was discovered locked and abandoned in the 16300 block of Croom Road on June 11, approximately ten miles from her boyfriend's house. Her boyfriend's brother and his friend located the car. The vehicle was headed in the opposite direction from Mileo's family's residence. Mileo's purse was inside and there were no apparent signs of a struggle or injury. The car was in a working condition. Foul play is suspected.",

            "circumstances": "Magaro was last seen departing a friend's residence in Kentmore Park, Maryland on February 22, 1987 at approximately 9:45 PM.\nMagaro was driving her 1976 gray four-door Ford Torino at the time. She was planning to drive back to her home in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania that evening.\nThe night of her disappearance there was a severe snow storm in the area. On the next day her vehicle was found in a field 100 feet west of State Route 213, two and a half miles south of the Bohemia River Bridge, which is north of Cecilton.\nHair, blood and human tissue was found in the car which had been burned.\nEven without a body, the medical examiner declared Magaro dead because of the amount of blood and brain matter found at the scene. The official cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head. Police recovered Magaro's pocketbook, her driver's license and a tube of lipstick in the field. Months after the disappearance, a crew cleaning the roads recovered a credit card of Magaro's near White Hall Road about 10-11 miles north of where the car was found. Nothing else was recovered during a search of the area.\nInvestigators interviewed witnesses who remember driving past the field and seeing a Ford Mustang with Pennsylvania license plates and its hazard lights on. One witness told police she saw a man talking to a woman in a car that resembled Magaro's gray Torino. While investigators were still searching for clues at the crime scene, they learned a man had attempted to use Magaro's credit card at a Sears department store in Bel Air to buy a television. Because the credit card was maxed out, the clerk kept the card and the man left the store without saying much. Although the witnesses' descriptions of the men differ slightly, police believe the two men could be the same person.\nPolice determined the car could not have broken down. It was in perfect working order with nearly seven gallons of gasoline in the tank - more than enough to get her to Elkton where she normally stopped.\nMagaro left behind a 4-year old son.",
