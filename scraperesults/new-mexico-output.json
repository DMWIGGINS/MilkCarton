On 10/01/1991, Jennifer left her home in Missoula and flew to San Diego, bringing her bicycle, camping gear, and two bibles. She planned to bike from San Diego to Las Cruces, NM, where she was to meet a missionary group and assist the poor, then on to visit Mexico.\n\nJennifer left San Diego riding her white Fuji mountain bicycle and carrying her backpack. From 10/01/1991 to 10/13/1991 she called her mother eight times, reporting her progress and her ambition to make it into Mexico. The morning of 10/17/1991, Jennifer called her mother for the last time from a Shell service station (which is no longer in operation) on Pine Street in Deming, NM, just 30 miles north of the Mexican border, to say she'd changed her plans. She'd heard that a woman alone in Mexico might be in danger, so she'd decided to go to Minnesota to see a friend. Jennifer's mother offered to pay for her transport there after she made more concrete plans, and Jennifer agreed to call her mother that evening. She never called back, never arrived at the friend's home, and has not been heard from again.\n\nAbout a year later, on 09/04/1992, two dove hunters found Jennifer's camping gear, bicycle helmet, and journals under a tarp in a remote area between Hatch and Deming off of State Road 26, about 46 miles northeast of Deming.",

She was familiar with the route to the monastery.\n\nEmma's 1997 white four-door Honda Civic with Arkansas tag #672-AOK was discovered on 09/13/1998, locked and abandoned, on Forest Road 375 near the Glorieta Baldy Peak in the Santa Fe National Forest. This location is approximately 10 to 15 miles from Route 63. Emma's car became lodged (high centered) on a large rock in the road.

He was treasurer of his bowling league and was carrying about $400 in cash on him. He did not return to the Sandia Base as of roll-call the next day, 07/01/1947. His broken glasses, necktie, army cap, and shirt with slash marks were found in a side street near the bowling alley. He has never been found. The FBI and the Defense Department spent much time and effort questioning family members, wire tapping their phones, and intercepting mail in the hopes that Gene would contact one of them but that did not happen. He was possibly privy to some sensitive information due to his job in the army at the base. His rank was corporal.",
