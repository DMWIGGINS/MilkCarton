When his boss came to pick him up the following Sunday evening, he was told by Davis' live-in girlfriend that she had last seen him at about 11 that morning, when he walked out of the trailer they shared.\nThe family and law enforcement searches over the years have produced no substantial results.\nIn the summer of 2006, the Dunn Police Department received a map with the location of the body of an alleged homicide victim. The map pinpoints the location as being close to the trailer park where Davis' used to live. This, and the name of \"Jimmy Davidic\" on the map, have led to speculation that the map is in reference to Mr. Davis.\nGround penetrating radar and foot searches have been conducted in the area. Local and state law enforcement are involved in Mr. Davis' case.\nHis social security number has not been active since his disappearance.\nMr. Davis has had previous connections to South Carolina and Maryland.\nHe has left his home in the past for extended periods of time, but always stayed in touch with his family, attending significant events such as his Mother's birthday, and Mother's Day.\nFoul play is suspected in his case.",

His parents last heard from him in January 1983.\nInvestigation by NC authorities showed that Clarke may have been placed on a plane by a member of the L'Abri Fellowship in early December 1983. He possibly flew to either Baltimore, Maryland or Washington DC. Clarke apparently then traveled to Asheville, NC by bus. He stayed in a motel while in the city on December 24, 1983.\nClarke then rented a car and drove to Tuckaseegee, NC with a friend. The two arrived in Atlanta, Georgia, at which time Clarke dropped the friend off and continued to Columbia, South Carolina to visit a friend.\nHe stayed with his friend for three days before returning to his hometown of Tuckaseegee, NC. Clarke's friends informed investigators that he did not want his parents to know that he was in Tuckaseegee during that time.\nClarke led a transient lifestyle. His family told the authorities that he did not possess any credit cards and paid for all purchases with cash.\nThere has been no sign of Clarke since December 1983. The friends he was in contact with told investigators they had not heard from since that time.",

He told friends that he was leaving the Carter-Finley Arena for a moment to go to his car; he never returned to the stadium.\n\nSimmons and his friends were students at the University of Western Florida at the time of his disappearance; they had driven to North Carolina to see the concert and intended to drive back to school immediately afterwards.\n\nSimmons' friends called his father in Florida to say that his son had disappeared and they could not locate him. His friends then returned to their home state. Simmons' father drove to Raleigh four days later and filed a missing person's report for his son. By the time the report was filed, most of the evidence at the scene of the concert -- if there indeed was any -- had vanished.\n\nInvestigators did receive one tip which they considered to be the strongest indication of Simmons' possible whereabouts in the week following his disappearance. A woman stated that she had spoken to an unidentified man fitting Simmons' description in New Jersey on July 16, 1990 -- six days after the Grateful Dead concert in Raleigh. The man was near a rest area in New Jersey and was extremely disoriented; the witness said he did not recall his own name, but said he was from Florida. She went across the street to locate a police officer, but by the time they returned to the rest stop, the man had disappeared again. There has been no sign of Simmons since that time.",

According to his friend they spent time working on a truck in a garage in the back yard and they were also riding four wheelers that afternoon. The friend's house is located in Alamance County less than half a mile from the residence of Brice Holliman's family. Between 5PM and 6PM Brice Holliman rode a four wheeler from his friend's house down the road approximately a half mile to his family's house. Upon arrival, he was told that dinner was not quite ready. Brice Holliman got back on the four wheeler and rode back down to his friend's house. According to his friend, Brice Holliman said he had a errand to run and he would be back in about 30 minutes. His friend said he left the residence between 6PM and 6:15PM driving his white 2000 Lexus with NC license plate CMN-9691. Brice Holliman was never seen or heard from again. His family attempted to call him multiple times when he failed to show up for dinner. After multiple attempts to contact him by family and friends, Brice Holliman was reported missing by his father 3 days later. Almost a month later on 5/4/2015, Brice Holliman's car was found abandoned next to creek in Orange County. There were no keys in the vehicle and all of the windows and the sunroof had been left open. Brice Holliman's hat and cell phone were found on the driver's side floorboard. Orange and Alamance County Sheriff's Offices are investigating.",

Two days later, her pale-green 1981 Buick Skylark was found in a restaurant parking lot. The window on the passenger side was shattered.\n\nMs. Gabriel's disappearance set off intense air, land and water searches the rest of that month in 1983. But it wasn't until February 1984, seven months later, that her ripped blue slacks, red shoes, pocketbook and car keys were discovered in woods not far from where her car had been abandoned. A suspect was arrested and convicted of Dianne's murder. Her body has never been found.",

His friends lost sight of him in rough waters around noon on June 18th, 2005. According to his diving partners, he was last seen on the surface about 50 feet from his boat, \"Details.\" A strong cross current swept him and his dive partner northwest of the boat during a free ascent after they failed to find the anchor line at the end of the 110 ft dive. One partner was recovered by the Coast Guard 9 hours later, 4 miles northwest of the dive site, and the third man made it back to the dive boat. Greg ditched his BC and tank in an attempt to make the swim to boat. Divers recovered Greg's weight belt on the bottom, open, 4 days later, but his body was never recovered. Greg was an advanced certification diver in a full wetsuit, mask, fins and snorkle, so close to the boat, so what happened to him remains a mystery. The US Coast Guard conducted 40 search missions that covered more than 1,000 square miles with aircraft and boats. Others have conducted private searches for Mickey as well.",

That is why his daughter, Lissa, does not believe that her father left on his own, without telling anyone what he was doing or where he was going.\n\nAccording to Lissa, Joseph left his home in Asheville on January 11, 2002, after he and his wife had a disagreement. He has not been seen or heard from since. Six months later, his truck was found in Tennessee off I-81 at a La Quinta. A security officer working there told Lissa the vehicle had been there for several months. She says her father knew the route well, using it to travel to New York when visiting relatives.\n\nLissa says it is too painful to speculate about what could have happened to her father. But Joseph was an avid photographer who always had his camera and the night he disappeared, both his wallet and camera were left behind. Lissa says that whatever happened to her father, it happened quickly. He would have never left his camera behind and in fact, he had plans to take it into work the next week to take photos.",

Key was last seen with the suspect in the bar parking lot. No one has seen her since.\nTwo days after her disappearance, Key's car was found, still parked in the same lot. Her door was unlocked. Her purse and jacket lay on the front seat.\nPolice processed Debbieâ\u20ac™s car as a crime scene. But when they received the car it seemed that the car had been detailed. The possibility of gathering physical evidence had been lost.\nIn 2004, the suspect confessed to Debbie's strangulation, but his statements were later thrown out in court due to the circumstances under which they were obtained. He stated that he brought her body to Wilmington and put her in a Dumpster.\nDebbie was single and lived with her mother in Chapel Hill. She loved animals and children. She earned most of her money from babysitting jobs around town, and lived a nomadic lifestyle.\nOften wore jeans. Favorite color was pink.",

The other person returned, but Bethea has never been heard from again.\nHe was last seen walking down Hudson Road toward N.C. 62 north at approximately 12.00pm. Tracker dogs were unable to pick up his scent anywhere. Bethea has lived in Corbett's Family Care Home for only ten days before his disappearance.\nHe had previously resided at the D & H Family Care Home for about six months, but was expelled after being caught smoking a cigarette in his room, in violation of the rules. He was unhappy about having to move to a new home\nand complained to his mother about his life before he disappeared. Bethea's family does not believe he left of his own accord and they think he was injured, possibly accidently, after his disappearance.",

            "circumstances": "Mr. Akopov disappeared after apparently driving to Raleigh and bringing home two other immigrants. Mr. Apokov was accustomed to going to Raleigh to meet with other Uzbekistanis, and it was normal for him to allow them to live with him at his Bladenboro-area home, until they found work. Mr. Akopov was last seen by his landlord getting into his vehicle, (1987 Plymouth Caravelle, 4-dr light blue, license LDN-9565, VIN#1P3BJ36K3HC135239) with two unknown males on September 12. His landlord describes them as two younger males, between 5'9 and 5'11\" tall, with stocky builds. Both were in their thirties. The day Akopov apparently disappeared, his landlord said she gave him directions to Nye's insurance office in Elizabethtown. She said he had been to Smithfield Packing Co. and the Employment Security Office with the two men earlier that day, apparently trying to help them find work. Mr. Akopov was known as a reliable employee and tenant. He did not report to work, pick up his paychecks, or pay his rent. His personal possessions were left at his usually \"neat as a pin\" home, in disarray, except a small dictionary he used for translation. His landlord reported him as missing on September 22. He has not been seen or heard from by either his friends locally or his family in Russia. He had around $500 or $600 cash in his wallet, according to his landlord. \"Plus his two paychecks.\" His last two paychecks were never cashed. Family members continued to write to Akopov until law enforcement and members of a missing persons group found a translator to help tell a family halfway around the world that their loved one was missing. Akopov had a wife and two children back in Uzbekistan. He regularly wrote letters to his family and other relatives, and sent photographs. Foul play is possible in his case. No sign of Akopov, his light-colored four-door Plymouth, or the two suspicious tenants has ever been found. However, the skeletal remains of a man around Akopov's age, wearing similar boots, were found near Wilmington. No positive identification has been made on the remains.",

He said she had left before and usually returned within a few days, so he was not concerned until her family became so.

He told his family that he was going to Vero Beach, FL to interview for a job ferrying Piper airplanes from the dealer to buyers. Jim Lewis was a recently-retired major with 25 years in the US Army -- a Ranger, founding member of the \"Golden Knights\" U.S. Army Parachute Team, a highly-decorated and wounded Vietnam veteran, a skilled pilot with commercial and seaplane ratings, as well as a dedicated husband and father. It was his habit on trips away from home to stay in phone contact with his wife; however, after his October 3 departure, he did not call home. In January 1983, Ms. Lewis received a call from a parking-lot attendant at the Fayetteville Municipal Airport informing her that the Ford Fiesta had been parked in the long-term lot since October 6, and was accumulating fees. The family reported the discovery of the vehicle to Fayetteville police, but the car was repossessed by the finance company before authorities investigated. In 1992, reading a news report of remains found in a nearby county, The family contacted the Hoke County Sheriff's Department but the discovered remains were determined to be those of another deceased. Soon after, The family had James Lewis declared legally dead. However, his remains were never found",

Volunteers searched a 7-mile radius around Canipe\u2019s home, for multiple days. More than 50 people from law enforcement and emergency personnel, along with police K-9\u2019s and drones found no trace of Canipe in the area.\nCanipe is 5-foot-9-inches tall, approximately 125-lbs and has short brown hair and green eyes. Due to conflicting statements, it is unknown as to what Canipe was last wearing at the time of his disappearance. He has no history of any medical condition that would cause him to become disoriented. The search for Canipe, which lasted about a week, was called off on January 21st 2016. The case remains open, and anyone with information is asked to call 911 or the Cleveland County Sheriff\u2019s Office at 704-484-4822.",
