Partial remains were found in 1986 and presumptively and circumstantially identified as Tina Coverdale (as well as her being declared deceased by Delaware courts).\n\nCIRCUMSTANCES:\nTina Coverdale was born March 30, 1963 In March 1985 she was nearing her twenty-second birthday. Tina last seen alive on Friday, March 15, 1985 by her boyfriend. They had been drinking at a local establishment. Tina was in her automobile and the boy friend has walked-off following a heated argument.\n\nTina was reportedly under the influence of alcohol and had not eaten. The following morning, the boy friend called Tinaâ\u20ac™s home, but learned she had never returned home nor had she spent the night or returned to a home she owned in Odessa, De.\n\nOn July 4, 1986, Tinaâ\u20ac™s vehicle was recovered upside down and on the bottom of the Smyrna River in 15-20' of water, 50' from shore, in Kent County Delaware off a location know as â\u20acœFlemings Landingâ\u20ac\u009d. Circumstantial evidence suggests she was driving and lost control of her vehicle, a 1981 Ford Mustang, Delaware Registration 792322. The keys were in the ignition and in the â\u20acœonâ\u20ac\u009d position. The same day, two other vehicles were recovered from approximately the same location in the Smyrna river.\n\nThe vehicle was resting on its roof in turbid water with very strong current. Two long bones were found by police divers within the interior of the vehicle on July 4, 1986. During the dragging of the vehicle from it underwater resting position onto land, the windows shattered, spilling contents into the strong currents of the river.\n\nAfter the vehicle was brought to shore, a segment of long bone was recovered from the mud still contained in the vehicle. The only remains recovered included a right tibia, fibula and proximal end of a femur.\n\nTwo more attempts were made by police divers, the latest on August 25, 1986 which resulted in no further recovery of skeletal or other evidence.\n\nCircumstantial evidence indicates that the remains found were those of Tine Coverdale (see uploaded documents); the skeletonization was consistent with death occurring on or about March 15, 1985. The bones were consistent with a female 23 years of age, with a margin of error of plus/minus 2 years. Height of the individuals was estimated of 58â\u20ac\u009d. Tina Coverdale was 22 years old and 57â\u20ac\u009d in height.\n\nDelawareâ\u20ac™s Chief Medical Examiner at the time (February 26, 1987) Dr. Ali Hameli stated â\u20acœit is, therefore, my opinion that, although a positive identification cannot be established, there is no evidence to the contrary to make a presumptive identification for Ms. Tina Coverdale. I must add that no cause or manner of death could be establishedâ\u20ac\u009d.\n\nTina Coverdale was adjudged to be presumed to have died on March 16, 1985 by a Delaware Chancery Court on August 10, 1987. The Delaware OCME issued a death certificate and the three bones were released to a funeral director.",

The first call (approx. 2:25pm) arranging a meeting to see a friend at the bar, and the second call (approx. 2:30pm) called his wife from a pay phone. She believes he was in the bar when he called her because of the background noise. Mrs. Perez claims that William was a regular at The Scoreboard Bar & Grill on 500 Maryland Ave. His friend didn't get there until 2:45pm but William was nowhere to be found. Mr. Perezâ\u20ac™s van was parked on Bird St. around the corner from the bar. On Oct. 6, 1990 at 10:14am Linda Perez reported her husband William Perez as missing. Additional information obtained from a woman claims that she saw Mr. Perez driving in an old beat up pickup truck driving down 896. The woman compared the face of the suspected Mr. Perez to a photo in the November 5th 1990 Wilmington News Journal article.\n\nPer court records (see documents section) \"In 1990, Defendant shot Willie Perez in the head after Perez came to Defendant's house to collect a debt. Perez's body was never recovered. Defendant was arrested in 1999 after the police obtained statements from Defendant's wife and friend about their involvement in disposing the victim's body and cleaning up the crime scene. A grand jury indicted Defendant on charges of Murder First Degree and Possession of a Deadly Weapon During the Commission of a Felony (â\u20acœPDWDCFâ\u20ac\u009d) in April 1999. A jury found him guilty of the lesser included offense of Murder Second Degree and of PDWDCF. Defendant was subsequently sentenced on June 16, 2000 to fifteen years at Level 5 for the murder conviction and fifteen years at Level 5 for the PDWDCF conviction.\"",

            "circumstances": "Anne Marie Fahey, the scheduling secretary for Delaware's then-Governor Thomas Carper, was last seen alive on Thursday, June 27, 1996, when she went to dinner with Capano in Philadelphia. Fahey's family reported on June 30, 1996, that she was missing. An extensive investigation concerning her disappearance ensued. That investigation culminated in November 1997, over sixteen months later, in Capano's arrest for her murder. Fahey's body was never found, however, and the State was unable to establish the precise manner by which Fahey died. Capano murdered Fahey at the house he rented and, with the assistance of his brother, Gerry, dumped her body in the Atlantic Ocean. On January 17, 1999, the trial resulted in Capano's conviction and he was sentenced to death. In January 2006, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed Capano's conviction but remanded the case for sentencing because the death penalty was imposed by a non-unanimous jury verdict. In February of that year, the state abandoned its efforts to seek capital punishment for Capano, opting to leave him imprisoned for life without parole. Capano, aged 61, was found dead in his jail cell at 12:34 p.m. on September 19, 2011 by an officer performing a routine security check at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center state prison near Smyra, Delaware, where Capano was imprisoned. The medical examiner said Capano died of sudden cardiac arrest.",

The police showed up at the family beach house in Keenwick, DE., three miles west of Fenwick Island to investigate. The police found no notes or papers to explain the whereabouts or time Mr. Gregory Snyder disappeared. The police did find a gun case in the bedroom with a magazine full of 9mm bullets. There was no gun found at the beach house. The neighbors said that they witnessed Mr. Gregory Snyder loading an ocean kayak on his truck a week ago, and returned without it. The family said that Mr. Gregory Snyderâ\u20ac™s credit cards have been canceled three weeks prior, and he has no other ways to get money. The Brother, in an interview, stated that Mr. Gregory Snyder is very muscular and was certified as a scuba diver and instructor, and that Mr. Gregory Snyder can easily kayak from an Ocean City inlet to Indian River, which is approximately thirty miles. Interviewing friends and family suggests that Mr. Gregory Snyder was depressed and had suicidal intentions. Mr. Gregory Snyderâ\u20ac™s vehicle was found on 136th St. and Ocean Front in Ocean City Maryland (just south of the Delaware southern border). Missing from the vehicle was Mr. Gregory Snyder, an ocean kayak and a 9mm handgun. There was no evidence of foul play found in the vehicle.",

U.S. Coast Guard personnel, Little Creek Fire Company, the DSP Dive Team and DNREC Fish and Wildlife responded to the area. Upon locating the boat, they found it void of any occupants. A search and rescue operation ensued and no one was located.\n\nThe boat was recently purchased by David R. Whitehair of Felton. Mr. Whitehair and his 17-year-old son David C. Whitehair were supposed to go on a chartered fishing trip yesterday; however, the trip was cancelled due to poor weather conditions. Mr. Whitehair decided to go anyway on his own boat and he took his son. They were last seen yesterday April 23, 2010 at 5:00 p.m.\n\nMP 7872's father David R. Whitehair body has been recovered from Delaware Bay.\n\nMP 7872, David Charles Whitehair's body has not been recovered. MP 7872, David Charles Whitehair is of Cherokee Indian descent.",

This was a witnessed event. Capt. Deibert's body was never found; a court has declared him dead.\n\nDetails:\nM/V Energy Enterprise was underway at a speed of 5.8 knots on a course of 235 degrees, inbound at the Delaware Capes Pilot Boarding area midway between CH Buoy and 6 Buoy. Last port was Providence, RI and bound for Baltimore, MD via the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal.\n\nCapt. Deibert had climbed 1/3 to 1/2 way up ladder, then paused for approximately 30 seconds. He took one step back down and suddenly let go, falling from ladder into water (landing on his back). Capt. Deibert did not strike anything during the fall. Life rings were immediately thrown and extensive search conducted.\n\nCapt. Deibert was wearing a life jacket.\nThe Ladder was not iced.\nAnother crew member climbed same ladder without incident.\n\nLocation of accident;\nLatitude 38 55.2486 N\nLongitude 075 05.8266 W\n2 miles off coast of Cape Henlopen at entrance to Delaware Bay\n38-46.8N, 075.02.5W\n\nVisibility: 12 Nautical Miles\nWind Speed: 25 Knots\nWinod Direction: 330\nWind Gusts: 40 Knots\nAir Temperature: 22f.\nWater Temperature: 39f.\nWave height: 6 -8'\n\n\n\nMedia:\nCOAST GUARD ENDS SEARCH FOR MISSING SHIP PILOT\nATLANTIC CITY, N.J. - Coast Guard crews have ended their search for a missing federal ship pilot who entered the water about two miles off the coast of Cape Henlopen, at the mouth of the Delaware Bay, Sunday night.\nMissing is Lynn Deibert, 52, a pilot with the Chesapeake Federal Pilots Association. Deibert's home of record is reported to be Virginia Beach, Va.\nSearch and rescue coordinators at Coast Guard Sector Field Office Atlantic City were contacted at about 11 p.m. Sunday and notified that Deibert fell into the water while attempting to board the motor vessel Energy Enterprise, a 645-foot U.S.-flagged freight ship bound for Baltimore. It was reported that Deibert was transferring from the pilot vessel Big Stone 5 to the freight ship when he fell from the freight ship's ladder and into the water, reportedly 39 degrees Fahrenheit.\nThe Coast Guard directed the launch of search crews aboard an HH-65C Dolphin rescue helicopter from Air Station Atlantic City, a 47-foot rescue boat and a 41-foot rescue boat from Station Cape May, N.J., and a 41-foot rescue boat from Station Indian River, Del. The Coast Guard Cutter Dependable, underway on a separate mission, was diverted to search the area.\nAt first light this morning, the Coast Guard directed the launch of another Air Station Atlantic City crew for what would be the third helicopter sortie. An Air Station Elizabeth City, N.C., HC-130 Hercules long-range aircraft was also directed to launch this morning. Following the early-morning helicopter search, the crews aboard the HC-130 Hercules aircraft and the Cutter Dependable searched until about 2:20 p.m.\nIn all, Coast Guard crews conducted 13 search sorties over a period of more than 14 hours in their search for Deibert.\nIt was reported that Deibert was wearing a personal flotation device when he entered the water. Witnesses to the accident reportedly threw three life rings into the water.\nOn-scene weather at the time of accident was reported as 20-25 knot winds, 6-foot seas and clear visibility.\nThe Big Stone 5 is enroute Lewes, Del., for further examination at a dock. The Energy Enterprise continued enroute Baltimore and is scheduled to be met by investigators from Coast Guard Sector Baltimore for inspection and crew interviews. The cause of the accident is under investigation by Coast Guard Sector Delaware Bay in Philadelphia.",

            "circumstances": "Patrick Lewis Sukeforth was a passenger on a 1987, 23' Chris Craft recreational power boat named \"The Hardwood\", which was traveling eastbound in the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal in Delaware City, Delaware, returning to their port of origin across the Delaware River in Pennsville, New Jersey. They traveled along the canal from the Chesapeake Inn, Chesapeake City, MD through Maryland and then Delaware waters.\n\nAround midnight, somewhere in the vicinity of exiting the canal or actually within the Delaware River, the boat struck underwater debris damaging and disabling the outdrive of the recreational boat. An anchor was placed and friends in New Jersey were called via cell phone to come provide a tow to shore. The anchor failed to hold bottom due to wakes from passing ships(s). The boat drifted generally east bound toward the center of the river which is the shipping lanes of Delaware River frequented by tankers.\n\nBetween 3:00 AM and 4:12 AM, a large tanker ship was observed bearing directly down upon the boat; the tanker was not responding to the occupants flashing light. A collision seemed eminent. Fearing being run down by the tanker, the boat owner stated Patrick grabbed a boat bumper and jumped over the side of the boat into the river; the boat owner also jumped into the river to get out of the path of the oncoming tanker.\n\nApproximately 45 minutes later, the boat owner (still in the water) was rescued by friends from New Jersey. Boat owner believed Patrick was swimming toward the general direction of Ft. Mott, which is the New Jersey side of the Delaware River. The water was still cold in May and currents in the Delaware River quite strong. The average depth of water in the shipping channel is 45â\u20ac™. Fort Mott is a 1896 fortification erected in anticipation of the Spanish-American War and typically a prominent landmark for boaters on the river.",
