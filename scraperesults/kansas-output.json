He would not let her drive him home, so she left him to get her brother's help. When she returned to the park, the car was still parked by the restrooms. The vehicle was locked and Tony's possessions were still inside.\n\nTony didn't show up for work the next day. His wife reported him missing on 05/19/1987. He has not contacted anyone in his family to let them know he is alive.\n\nTony was devoted to both his children and the disappearance was uncharacteristic. He had been living in Salina for about nine years. Tony is originally from New York. His parents emigrated from Italy and settled on Thompson Street in Greenwich Village before moving to Astoria.",

Ross' mother and brothers went to his apartment on East Harry.

She had just started working as a legal secretary for a local attorney in the city of Hays. Mary was taking papers to other attorneys in town to be signed when she disappeared. Her car was found with the door open approximately 3 inches, and her purse and legal papers were found inside the vehicle. Days later, a search team found her coat along a country road six miles northwest from town with her car keys in the pocket. Her body was never found. Foul play is suspected.",
