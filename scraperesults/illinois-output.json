            "circumstances": "Robert was a WWII veteran who served in Iwo Jima. He may have contracted malaria during his time in the Pacific. In the mid 1950s he had a nervous breakdown and may not have had a job after that. He lived with his father until his father\u2019s death in 1977. After that, Robert lived with his uncle Franklin Olson at 6050 North Hermitage in Chicago. After Franklin died in 1984, the house was vacant but Robert may have lived there for a while on his own. The family lost track of Robert when his sister Gertrude died in 1997. Robert often wore multiple layers of clothing and carried a lot of personal documents on his person. Robert broke his heel in the 1950s. He has a scar on the outside of one heel and one hip. (It is believed that some bone was taken from the hip to repair the heel. Not sure which side of the body was affected.) His eyes were hazel, and his hair was medium brown but turned gray in later years. He had a slender build when in his 30s but put on weight as he got older.",

It was during this period that Koppel became pregnant and was coerced to undergo an abortion. Shortly afterwards, Koppel began making wild accusations about Stein, and demanded a large financial settlement to let things drop.\n\nStein asked a long-time friend \u2013 then-Chicago cop Richard \"Rick\" Simon, who moonlighted for Stein\u2019s firm \u2013 to help amicably resolve things, according to police records and interviews.\n\nSimon met with Koppel at Flapjaw's saloon, 810 N. Wabash Avenue, the night she disappeared. According to published reports Simon offered Koppel $10,000 and the free use of a Lake Shore Drive apartment in return for her agreement to exit quietly.\n\nKoppel has never been seen since this meeting.\n\nThere was speculation at the time that the woman was murdered and dumped in the middle of Lake Michigan.\n\nSimon said in an interview he doesn\u2019t know what happened to Koppel, but doesn\u2019t buy that she was murdered. Rather, he suspects she\u2019s still alive with a new identity, having left Chicago because she was mentally unstable and horribly \"humiliated\" at being spurned by Stein.",

            "circumstances": "Martin was last seen at her home in Lincoln, Illinois on June 2, 1976. Her husband was the last person to see her, before he left for work between 6:00 and 6:30 a.m. Martin was supposed to go to work at 9:00, but she never arrived and has never been heard from again. A witness saw her car driving northbound on U.S. 66 at 9:15 a.m., but its driver could not be identified. Two days after her disappearance, her vehicle was found abandoned in the parking lot of the Holiday Inn in Bloomington, Illinois. Martin did not check into the inn, however. Her car had a flat tire and there was a considerable amount of Type A blood, which is Martin's type, in the trunk when it was found. Authorities found Type A bloodstains and a .22 caliber bullet on the floor of her home garage after she disappeared. There were no indications of forced entry to the home. Martin was scheduled to testify against Russell Smrekar, who was accused of shoplifting two steaks (worth $4) from a Kroger grocery store. He was subsequently convicted of murdering Robin and Jay Fry and was sentenced to 200 to 600 years in prison. He is eligible for parole every three years, but has been denied every time. Jay was the store clerk who saw Smrekar try to steal the steaks and was going to testify against him at the trial. Robin was Jay's wife, and was pregnant at the time of her death. Smrekar was also believed to be responsible for Martin's disappearance and for the disappearance of Michael Mansfield, a witness against him in an unrelated burglary case, but he was never charged in connection with their cases.\n\nA photograph of Smrekar is posted below this case summary. In October 2011, shortly before he died in prison at the age of 56, he confessed to Mansfield and Martin's murders. He said he buried Martin's body under Interstate 55, which was under construction at the time, late at night on the same day of her disappearance. He was unable to give a precise location, however. Investigators announced that, in light of Smrekar's confession, they were closing Martin and Mansfield's cases.\n\nMartin was employed as a real estate agent at the time of her disappearance.",

She and the driver speak for some time before she enters the vehicle shortly after 2 p.m., which then continues north on Goodwin Avenue.\n\nUniversity police said Zhang had just gotten off a public bus before the four-door hatchback approached her on the north end of the university campus.\nZhang can be seen standing by a tree as a black Saturn Astra pulls up next to her. She had a brief conversation with the driver before entering the vehicle.\nThe FBI says the vehicle appeared to be driven by a white male who circled the area before making contact with Zhang.\nZhang is 5-foot-4 and weighs 110 pounds, according to the FBI. She was last seen wearing a charcoal-colored baseball cap, a pink and white top, jeans and white tennis shoes. She carried a black backpack.",

A garage manager watched Andrews drive the wrong way - heading north in the southbound lanes - on Michigan Avenue. The theory prevails that the couple may have accidentally driven into the Chicago River and drowned, even though subsequent searches have proved nothing.\n\nThe following Monday police were called to the Andrews' house in Arlington Heights. Coworkers at the loan company where Stephania Andrews was a credit investigator thought it unusual when she failed to arrive Monday morning. Edward Andrews also hadn't checked in with his employer. He was a manager for Miller-Peerless Manufacturing.\n\nAt the Andrews' house, police found several newspapers untouched on the front lawn. Letters had piled up in the mailbox. The neighbors had a key, which they used to open the door for police. Inside everything was orderly. The only items obviously missing were the dress and jewelry Stephania Andrews had worn to the party.",

Andrews met Nowicki for the first time that day. After some time there, Nowicki allegedly offered to drive the girls home. On the way home, they were involved in an accident in which Andrew's ankle was injured. Nowicki said he would take Andrews to the hospital, if the other two women would get the car towed.\nInstead of taking Andrews to the hospital, Nowicki took her back to his apartment, where he drugged and sexually assaulted her.\n\nNowicki allegedly called a friend to help him put the body in the trunk of his mother's car. Andrews' body has never been found.\nNowicki was convicted of her homicide in July 2005",
