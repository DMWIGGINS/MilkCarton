Initial park response included searching the last known area by air and an immediate hasty search by rangers. For the past six days park rangers have extensively searched the river between River Miles 211-225 and on land stretching from River Mile 211-215.\n\nHeimer is described as a 22 year old male, 6\u2019 tall, blond hair, blue eyes and was last seen wearing a dark-colored Astral personal flotation device, a blue plaid long sleeve shirt, a pair of Chaco flip-flop sandals, a maroon baseball cap, and brightly colored shorts. Morgan was also carrying a purple water bottle with him when he was last seen. Heimer is working as a guide for Tour West and the group was on day 6 of an 8 day trip when Heimer went missing.\n\nWith no additional clues to guide search efforts on land or water, the search will be scaled back to a continuous, but limited mode in which rangers and pilots will continue to search for clues when in the area. In addition, flyers with Heimer\u2019s picture and description remain posted at various South Rim locations and all launching river trips will briefed on searching for Heimer.\n\nThe National Park Service is currently conducting a Search and Rescue operation. A missing persons investigation is on-going. No further information is available at this time. Any individual with information on the location of Morgan Heimer should contact the National Park Service Tip Line at 928-638-7840.",

They arrived so Dorthy could purchase cigarettes for Danielle's father. They had also purchased ice cream cones and used a pay phone outside the store before leaving. They were last seen by friends who drove past the Pitchers on their route home walking near the intersection of State Route 181 and 191.\nSearch dogs picked up the Pitchers' scents at the store and approximately one and a half miles into their route home along the highway.

They crossed the border, and had walked for one week, and were headed towards Tucson (they were told). They crossed the border on a Tuesday morning. They walked until Thursday\u2014that is when Maria started getting a severe headache. On Friday, they ran out of water. Later in the day on Friday evening, they found a large water tank. It was rusty metal, about 3 feet high, with a ladder on the side. There were cows in the area. The water tank was located near the bank of an arroyo or dry stream bed. On Friday night, Maria fainted. She started bleeding\u2014 there was a lot of blood on her pants, so she changed into a pair of her son's pants (boy's pants, too big for her). She was able to continue until Sunday afternoon, when Maria fainted again and couldn\u2019t speak. They moved her under a big tree, in the shade. She was extremely weak, and told her son she couldn\u2019t go on. The coyote insisted that they had to go on, and they convinced her son to leave his mother (they told him another group was coming behind them, and would pick her up). The group met the truck 2-4 hours from where they left her. The truck picked them up and drove 6 hours to a farm/ranch. Another car met them there, and then there was a 2-3 hour drive to Phoenix.",

The man, later identified as Haruchika Miyagi, told her he was looking for a place to stay and she declined to allow him to remain on her property. Haruchika sped away in the red Mazda sedan and crashed through a gate before leaving the property. Deputies found the Mazda two hours later in a wash near the Med Bar Road property. It was abandoned and heavily damaged.\n\nFriends and family reported Haruchika missing as they were concerned because he did not show up for work. His family does not know why he went to Arizona. A search and follow-up with local hospitals has been unsuccessful. Haruchika may have a cell phone with him, but recent checks indicate it is off.",

At the time of his disappearance, Mr. Simmons had no known medical or physical disabilities. His Ford F-150 pickup was found abandoned on January 17, three days after his disappearance, in a tow-away zone across the street from a warehouse where he and his partner collected and sold semi-precious minerals. There was no sign of Simmons at the scene, nor were there indications of a struggle. Police suspect foul play was involved. There has been no activity on Simmons' finances, no sightings, and he has no history of disappearing",

She then transported his body to a remote camp in Chinle, Arizona, where she reportedly burned his body.\n\nDetectives processed the scene and recovered various small bone fragments. Due to the degraded condition of the bones, DNA testing could not definitively prove these bones were Daniel's.\n\nLarisa was arrested for Daniel's murder and in September 2011, she pled guilty to manslaughter. She was sentenced to 10 years in the Department of Corrections.\n\nDaniel's DNA profile has been entered into CODIS in the event that remains which can be tested are located in the future.",
