Jimmy Black said Joe Frank Ussery, 77, was reported missing late in the evening Nov. 27, and officers immediately started trying to track him down.\n\nBlack said investigators have conducted multiple interviews with his family, friends and neighbors and have even spoken to hunters who attended a big Thanksgiving Day hunt on his property.\n\nThe captain said three separate searches of the area around his home on Damascus Church Road were conducted, which were expanded to the Hungerford Road area. He said the department received assistance in the searches by the Aviation Unit of the Georgia State Patrol (helicopter), Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge, the Department of Natural Resources, the U.S. Forest Service, and Tracy Sargent of K9 Search & Rescue Specialists, as well as volunteers from the Jones County Board of Education, the Jones County Fire Department, neighbors, friends, family, and numerous deputies.\n\n\u201cWe have chased down several leads we have received throughout the Middle Georgia area, but so far none of them have been fruitful.\n\n\u201cWe are continuing to follow any information we receive,\u201d Black said.\n\nThe captain said Ussery does not drive and is known to hitch a ride to Gray and hang out in local businesses.\n\n\u201cWe all know and have talked to Mr. Joe,\u201d he said.\n\nBlack said Ussery\u2019s wife was out of town with relatives for Thanksgiving, but he did not want to go and stayed at home.\n\n\u201cWe have talked to everyone he talked to Wednesday. He has a mobile phone, but it was found at his home,\u201d he said.\n\nBlack said anyone who has seen or heard from Ussery since Nov. 23 is asked to contact the Jones County Sheriff\u2019s Office at 478-986-3489.\n\n-- Debbie Lurie-Smith | debbie@jcnews.com\n\n\nCategory:",

There have been various other reports regarding Edney's whereabouts throughout the years, but none of the leads have panned out.\nEdney's family believes that a driver stopped and picked Edney up the day of her disappearance. Foul play is not suspected in her case. Investigators believe that she may have died as a result of exposure to the elements. Edney's daughter stated that her mother did not want to return to the home after a visit elsewhere on the day of her disappearance.

He left his wallet behind, inside his home.\nBirchfield was caring for his roommate's elderly mother at the time of his disappearance. She died two weeks later. His family has said it is very uncharacteristic of him to vanish and not attempt to contact loved ones. Authorities believe it is possible Birchfield disappeared to prevent his family from having to watch him die as a result of his terminal illness.

Long was born in Memphis, Tennessee, but grew up in Macon.\nOn August 13, 1991, Long worked her second shift job at Bibb Manufacturing. She got off work at 11 p.m. and stopped by her boyfriend's to trade cars - she'd been driving his Camaro because her truck was having problems. The boyfriend drove her home and left. Long phoned her mother between 12:30 AM and 1:30 AM. She said she was going to visit a neighbor.\nLong's stepfather returned home at approximately 3:00 AM. The lights were on inside and Long's truck was in the driveway, but Long wasn't there.\nLong's boyfriend arrived at her stepfather's home during the morning hours of August 15, looking for her. A call to Bibb Manufacturing revealed Sabrina hadn't called or shown up for work Wednesday. She also hadn't picked up her paycheck. Her work clothes from Tuesday were on the floor of her bedroom. Her purse and makeup were in the house. Her neighbor said that she never had plans to visit his house on August 14.\nLong's mother said that her daughter received several obscene phone calls prior to her disappearance. Long scheduled an interview with a local company during the summer of 1991 and was excited about the possibility of working there. Her mother said that Long learned an appointment had never been scheduled when she called to confirm the time shortly afterwards.\nThere were rumors that Long had a secret boyfriend who lived near Lake Tobesofkee who might have picked her up. No evidence has been located to substantiate the rumors.",

Blood was found in the house and carport. Nothing was taken from the home. A white pickup truck was seen in the area during this period.\n\nHer automobile, a 1985 tan and black Chevrolet, S-10 Blazer was found the next day in DeKalb County behind Decatur High School. Blood was found in the vehicle. The keys were left in the vehicle and cash was placed in plain view in what investigators believe was an effort to \"bait\" the vehicle for potential car thieves.\n\nInvestigators believe that at least two people were involved in the abduction.\n\nShe was living with her two sons and had been separated from her husband since November 1989. She and her husband were scheduled to finalize their divorce and disposition of property at 5 p.m. the day she disappeared",

When he and some friends left the party, some headlights followed their car along the Swamp Road and all the way into Waycross until they turned onto a side street and headed home.\nLater that day, a Georgia trooper found Rouse's light blue Ford Thunderbird parked halfway behind the entrance sign at Okefenokee Swamp Park, a spot easily seen from U.S. 1 and a CSX railroad. The car was left idling with its radio playing and a window rolled down. It had run out of gas and the battery was low. A pack of cigarettes and a lighter was on the passenger seat.

The call may have been related to her work at the National Cash Register Company (Fayetteville, Georgia) in the computer center. Another call came in at approximately 10:00 p.m., from what again sounded work related. Upon hanging up, Morgan told her mother that she had to go to work to straighten out a problem with a computer. This was the last time Morgan's mother saw her. Morgan changed her clothes and left the residence. Morgan's mother did not see what she was wearing when she left home.\nOn Wednesday, May 16, 1984, a vehicle belonging to Helen Ann Morgan was discovered at Atlanta Hartsfield International Airport apparently abandoned in the south terminal parking lot. Morgan had been reported missing on May 14, 1984, from Lamar County, Georgia. Her mother last saw Morgan on Sunday, May 13, 1984, (Mother's Day).\nDuring the investigation, Morgan was described as being a very conscientious person with a great deal of ambition and not the type to leave without notifying anyone. Morgan occasionally visited a bar called \"Frady's\" in Peachtree City with her friends but was not the type person to be picked up by anyone at a bar. Prior to Morgan's disappearance, Morgan did not seem upset nor had she made any indication that she was making plans to travel.\n\nSince Morgan's disappearance, no purchases or any activity has been noted on any of Morgan's financial accounts.",

She was employed as a scorekeeper and sports equipment salesperson. She arrived for her shift at approximately 8:40 a.m. on March 26, 1994. Melendi agreed to keep score during a game at Field Number One after her employer mistakenly slated her for a shift after a scheduling conflict. Melendi worked until approximately 12:40 p.m. that day. She was seen shortly thereafter across the street from the club at the Citgo gas station, where she purchased a soft drink. She took a lunch break and was never seen again. Police found her car parked at a nearby Citgo gas station unlocked, with the keys in the ignition.\nIn August 2004, Colvin \"Butch\" Hinton was charged with Melendi's abduction and murder. He was convicted in September 2005. Hinton stated he had lured Melendi into his car, then forced her to drive to his home and raped her at knifepoint before strangling her. He stated he burned her body and discarded the ashes. In light of Hinton's confession, authorities are renewing the search for Melendi's remains.",

It was her day off, but she had gone there to run inventory. That same day, someone started a fire at the company. The fire triggered the sprinkler system, but the sprinkers were not connected to an alarm, so the water poured for hours without being detected. When employees arrived the following morning, the water was ankle-deep on the floor. Near Geise's desk, where the fire had started, was a pool of blood.\nDue to the circumstances, authorities began searching for Geise immediately. Her purse was found on the roof of a nearby building; nothing was missing except the keys to Geise's car, a 1983 Nissan Pulsar. The vehicle was found parked a block away. In the woods near Geise's workplace was a 10-pound doorstop and a cloth mail card, both stained with blood. Some bloodstains were also found on the door of a company van. There was no sign of Geise or her remains. Authorities attempted to test the blood at her work site for DNA, but the water had destroyed the DNA in the blood. It had been raining the day Geise disappeared and the bloodstained items outside got wet.",

Navy stationed at Naval Air Station in Bermuda. Morse came home to Cobb County, Georgia on leave in October 1989 and at the end of his leave period was to have returned to Bermuda. At the end of his leave Morse told his Mother he would see her at Christmas and left. That night someone from the NAS in Bermuda called Morse's father looking for Morse.\n\nIt was soon learned that Morse had told his mother that his father would take him to the airport for the return trip and told his father that his mother would take him. Based on this inconsistency, the assumption was made that Morse had gone AWOL.\n\nEarly efforts to list Alan as missing met with reluctance since there was no apparent evidence of foul play. Alan's disappearance and subsequent lack of contact with family is completely out of character for Alan in that he enjoyed an unusually close relationship with other family members. A missing person report was taken in 2007.\nThe Navy has advised Alan's family that they will not prosecute Alan for being AWOL.",
